## Narrative I: Investment Thesis

### Business Model Overview

Dave Inc. is a leading U.S. neobank operating a differentiated fintech platform that serves financially vulnerable Americans living paycheck to paycheck. The company's primary value proposition is providing short-term liquidity solutions as an alternative to expensive traditional bank overdraft fees.

**Core Business Segments:**

1. **ExtraCash Product (Primary Revenue Driver):** Short-term cash advances of $25-$500 (average $207 in Q3 2025) with typical 1-2 week duration. This product generates revenue through:
   - 5% processing fee (capped at $15, minimum $5)
   - 1.5% instant transfer fee to external accounts
   - No interest, no late fees, no credit check required

2. **Dave Banking/Dave Card:** Full-service checking accounts with no overdraft fees, no minimum balance requirements, featuring:
   - 4% APY on deposits
   - Free ATM access at 40,000+ locations
   - Early direct deposit (2-day)
   - Mastercard debit card generating interchange revenue

3. **Subscription Revenue:** $3/month subscription fee for new members (legacy members grandfathered at $1/month)

**Competitive Position:**

Dave differentiates itself through:
- **CashAI Underwriting Engine:** Proprietary AI-driven underwriting system analyzing 0.5 billion transactions and 200+ variables to assess credit risk using real-time cash flow data rather than traditional FICO scores
- **Low Customer Acquisition Cost:** CAC of $19 vs. competitors like Chime at $100+
- **Capital-Light Model:** Short duration (~8 days average) enables rapid learning cycles and minimal balance sheet risk
- **Digital-First Operations:** 300 employees serving 13.5 million total members, demonstrating massive operating leverage

### Moat Analysis

**Sources of Competitive Advantage:**

1. **Data and AI Moat (MEDIUM-HIGH):** Over 160 million ExtraCash originations have trained CashAI, creating a proprietary underwriting capability that continues to improve with scale. The short feedback loops (8-day average duration) enable rapid model optimization.

2. **Cost Structure Moat (HIGH):** Digital-only operations with ~300 employees vs. hundreds of thousands at traditional banks. Variable operating expenses per MTM are significantly lower than legacy banks with branch networks.

3. **Brand Recognition (MEDIUM):** Word-of-mouth drives ~33% of acquisitions, indicating strong brand equity among target demographic. "Dave vs. Goliath" positioning resonates with underbanked Americans.

4. **Network Effects (LOW-MEDIUM):** Limited direct network effects, though member data enhances underwriting for all users.

**Moat Durability Concerns:**
- Regulatory risk (DOJ lawsuit pending)
- Single bank partner dependency (Evolve Bank, transitioning to Coastal Community Bank)
- Competition from well-capitalized fintechs and traditional banks
- Durbin exemption status critical for interchange economics

### Management Assessment

**Leadership Team:**
- **Jason Wilk (Founder/CEO):** Strong product vision and execution track record. Founded company in 2017 with clear mission to disrupt predatory bank fees. Has successfully navigated multiple business model iterations.
- **Kyle Beilman (CFO/COO):** Drives operational discipline and financial transparency. Strong track record of exceeding guidance.
- **Parker Barrile (new CPO):** Recently hired to accelerate product development, including BNPL offering.

**Capital Allocation:**
- $125 million share repurchase authorization announced
- Transitioning to off-balance sheet funding with Coastal Community Bank to unlock $100M+ liquidity
- Conservative leverage with $75M debt facility (stable utilization)

**Alignment:** Founder-led with significant insider ownership. Management consistently beats guidance and raises outlook.

### Key Risks

**Bear Case Risks:**

1. **Regulatory Risk (HIGH):** Department of Justice lawsuit pending. CFPB uncertainty. State-level regulatory changes could impact ExtraCash product structure.

2. **Credit Deterioration (MEDIUM):** 28-day delinquency at 2.33% (up from 1.78% YoY) though management describes this as intentional optimization for gross profit. 121-day charge-off rate ~1.46%.

3. **Bank Partner Concentration (MEDIUM-HIGH):** Evolve Bank consent order and transition to Coastal Community Bank creates execution risk.

4. **Consumer Credit Environment (MEDIUM):** 69% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck (up from 57% in 2021) provides TAM tailwind but could indicate systemic credit stress.

5. **Competition (MEDIUM):** Chime, Cash App, and traditional banks may intensify competition. Banks' Durbin-exempt status advantage could be reduced by regulatory changes.

## Narrative II: Invested Capital Methodology

### Invested Capital Definition

For Dave Inc., invested capital is defined as the economic capital required to fund ongoing operations and growth, excluding excess cash and financial instruments unrelated to core operations.

**IC Formula:**
```
Invested_Capital = Total_Assets - Excess_Cash - Non_Operating_Liabilities - Accounts_Payable
```

**Specific Adjustments for Dave:**

1. **ExtraCash Receivables:** Included as operational capital (net of allowance for credit losses). This is the working capital deployed to generate ExtraCash revenue.

2. **Restricted Cash:** Included as operational (regulatory requirements for bank partnership)

3. **Excess Cash:** Cash above minimum operating requirement (~$15M per debt covenant) treated as excess

4. **Intangible Assets (Internally Developed Software):** Included as operational—this is core infrastructure for the CashAI platform

5. **Debt Facility:** Treated as financing rather than operational capital for ROIC purposes

### Y0 Invested Capital Calculation (as of September 30, 2025)

| Component | Amount ($000) |
|-----------|---------------|
| Total Assets | 433,251 |
| Less: Excess Cash | (35,000) |
| Less: Warrant/Earnout Liabilities | (17,240) |
| Less: Deferred Tax Assets | (30,277) |
| **Operating Invested Capital** | **~350,734** |

**Note:** This capital base includes net ExtraCash receivables of $268M (gross) which generate the majority of revenue.

### ROIC Interpretation

Given Dave's asset-light business model with short-duration receivables, ROIC must be interpreted carefully:

1. **High ROIC Potential:** Minimal fixed assets, low CapEx intensity, and rapid receivables turnover (~12x annually) should generate high returns on invested capital

2. **Off-Balance Sheet Transition:** Coastal Community Bank arrangement will shift receivables off balance sheet, dramatically reducing invested capital and potentially creating artificial ROIC inflation

3. **Alternative Metrics:** Gross Profit per MTM and LTV/CAC ratios (currently 4-month payback) may be more meaningful for this business model than traditional ROIC

## Narrative III: Economic Governors

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

**Primary TAM:** ~185 million financially vulnerable or financially coping Americans (per Financial Health Network 2025 data)
- Up from ~165 million in 2021
- Defined as: Trouble managing cash flow, minimal savings, need for short-term liquidity, overdraft up to 20x/year

**Served Available Market (SAM):**
- Dave's target: Americans earning under $100,000/year who are underserved by traditional banks
- Approximately 150 million Americans meet core criteria
- Current penetration: 2.77 million MTMs / 150M SAM = ~1.8%

**Market Growth Drivers:**
- Elevated inflation and interest rates increasing paycheck-to-paycheck living
- Personal savings rate at 5% (down from 9% pre-pandemic)
- Growing Gen Z/Millennial population (75%+ of Dave members)
- Continued digital banking adoption

### Mean Reversion Targets

**Revenue Growth:**
- Y0 (LTM Sep 2025): ~$540M revenue (annualized guidance midpoint)
- Historical growth: 34% (2024), 63% (Q3 2025 YoY)
- Terminal growth expectation: 2-3% (GDP proxy at steady state)
- Fade period: 10-15 years as market matures

**EBIT Margin:**
- Current Adjusted EBITDA margin: ~39% (Q3 2025)
- Non-GAAP Gross Margin: 69%
- Target terminal EBIT margin: 20-25% (accounting for normalized SBC, continued R&D investment)

**ROIC:**
- Current ROIC difficult to assess given capital transition
- Terminal ROIC expectation: 15-20% (financial services norm with technology efficiency)

### Long-Term Equilibrium Assumptions

**Industry Maturity Characteristics:**
- Fintech neobank sector still in growth phase
- Regulatory environment evolving (could compress or expand opportunity)
- Technology advantages tend to erode over time as competitors adopt similar solutions

**Competitive Convergence:**
- Entry barriers moderate (technology replicable, regulatory barriers exist)
- Expect margin compression as market matures and competition intensifies
- Dave's data advantage should provide some durability but not permanent protection

## Narrative IV: Discount Rate Derivation

### Risk Factor Assessment

**Systematic Risk Factors:**

1. **Business Model Maturity (X adjustment: +0.3)**
   - 8 years operating history
   - Recently achieved sustained profitability
   - Business model proven but still evolving

2. **Revenue Concentration (X adjustment: +0.2)**
   - Heavy dependence on ExtraCash product (~70%+ of revenue)
   - Single bank partner (transitioning)
   - Consumer credit exposure

3. **Regulatory Environment (X adjustment: +0.4)**
   - Active DOJ lawsuit
   - State-level regulatory uncertainty
   - Evolve Bank consent order impacts

4. **Competitive Position (X adjustment: +0.1)**
   - Strong unit economics and cost advantages
   - Growing market share
   - But large well-funded competitors exist

5. **Financial Leverage (X adjustment: +0.1)**
   - Modest debt ($75M facility)
   - Strong liquidity position
   - Off-balance sheet transition reduces balance sheet risk

6. **Management/Governance (X adjustment: -0.1)**
   - Founder-led with strong track record
   - Consistent execution and guidance beats
   - Transparent communication

### X Multiplier Calculation

| Factor | Adjustment |
|--------|------------|
| Business Model Maturity | +0.3 |
| Revenue Concentration | +0.2 |
| Regulatory Environment | +0.4 |
| Competitive Position | +0.1 |
| Financial Leverage | +0.1 |
| Management Quality | -0.1 |
| **Total X Adjustment** | **+1.0** |

**Base X = 1.0 (average risk)**
**Adjusted X = 1.0 + 1.0 = 2.0** (above-average risk)

### Discount Rate Calculation

```
DR = RFR + (X × ERP)
DR = 4.5% + (2.0 × 5.0%)
DR = 4.5% + 10.0%
DR = 14.5%
```

**Rationale for X = 2.0:**

Dave operates in a higher-risk segment of financial services (subprime/near-prime consumer lending) with significant regulatory overhang and concentration risks. While the company has demonstrated strong execution and unit economics, the regulatory uncertainty (DOJ lawsuit, CFPB) and dependence on a single bank partner warrant a risk premium above the market average. The X of 2.0 reflects this elevated but not extreme risk profile, balancing the proven business model against material execution and regulatory risks.

## Summary

Dave Inc. represents a compelling but risk-elevated investment opportunity in the U.S. neobank sector. The company has demonstrated strong execution with accelerating MTM growth (17% YoY), record ARPU expansion (39% YoY), and improving unit economics under its new pricing model. The CashAI underwriting engine provides a data-driven competitive advantage, and the company's cost structure enables profitability serving customers that legacy banks cannot economically service.

Key value drivers for the forecast include:
1. **MTM growth** from improved conversion and large reactivation pool (11M dormant members)
2. **ARPU expansion** from subscription price increases, new BNPL product, and ExtraCash monetization
3. **Operating leverage** as fixed costs scale with revenue growth

Primary risks requiring ongoing monitoring:
1. DOJ lawsuit outcome and regulatory developments
2. Bank partner transition execution (Evolve to Coastal)
3. Credit performance under economic stress scenarios
4. Competitive response from well-capitalized incumbents and fintechs

The discount rate of 14.5% (X = 2.0) reflects elevated but manageable risks appropriate for a profitable, growing fintech with significant regulatory uncertainty.
