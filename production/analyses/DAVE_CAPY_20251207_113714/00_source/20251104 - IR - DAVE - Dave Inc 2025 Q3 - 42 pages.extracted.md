This presentation of Dave Inc. (“Dave” or the “Company”) includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “future,” “growth,” “opportunity,”
“well-positioned,” "forecasts," "intends," “estimates,” “seeks," "targets," “anticipates,” “remains,” “should,” “believes,” “expects,” “plans,” “outlook,” and “projects” and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. Such forward-looking
statements include, but are not limited to, financial guidance for fiscal year 2025, statements regarding future growth, market share gains, and Dave’s other expectations regarding its future plans and financial performance. Such forward-looking statements with respect to future financial performance, strategies,
prospects and other aspects of the business of Dave are based on current expectations that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this presentation, and on the current expectations of Dave's management and are not predictions of
actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability.
A number of factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: the ability of Dave to compete in its highly competitive industry; the ability of Dave to keep pace with the rapid technological
developments in its industry and the larger financial services industry; the ability of Dave to manage risks associated with providing ExtraCash; the ability of Dave to retain its current customers, acquire new customers (collectively, “Members”) and sell additional functionality and services to its Members; the
ability of Dave to protect intellectual property and trade secrets; the ability of Dave to maintain the integrity of its confidential information and information systems or comply with applicable privacy and data security requirements and regulations; the primary reliance by Dave on a single bank partner; the ability
of Dave to maintain or secure current and future key banking relationships and other third-party service providers, including its ability to comply with applicable requirements of such third parties; the ability of Dave to comply with extensive and evolving laws and regulations applicable to its business; changes in
applicable laws or regulations and extensive and evolving government regulations that impact operations and business; the ability to attract or maintain a qualified workforce; the level of product service failures that could lead Members to use competitors’ services; investigations, claims, disputes, enforcement
actions, arbitration, litigation and/or other regulatory or legal proceedings, including the Department of Justice’s lawsuit against Dave; the ability to maintain the listing of Dave Class A Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market; the possibility that Dave may be adversely affected by other macroeconomic
factors, including regulatory uncertainty, fluctuating interest rates, inflation, unemployment rates, consumer sentiment, market volatility, and business, and/or competitive factors; and other risks and uncertainties discussed in Dave’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”) on March 4, 2025 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the heading “Risk Factors,” filed with the SEC and other reports and documents Dave files from time to time with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and Dave undertakes
no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release.
You are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, including the projections, which speak only as of the date made. Dave does not undertake any commitment to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Accordingly, forward-looking statements, including any projections or analysis, should not be viewed as factual and should not be relied upon as an accurate prediction of future results. The forward-looking statements contained in this presentation are based on the Company’s current expectations and beliefs
concerning future developments and their potential effects on Dave. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control), or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by
these forward-looking statements.
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of management’s assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Dave does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. Accordingly, you should not put undue reliance on these statements.
USE OF PROJECTIONS
This presentation contains financial forecasts with respect to certain financial measurements of Dave, including, but not limited to Dave’s projected GAAP Revenue and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for Dave’s fiscal year 2025. Such projected financial information constitutes forward-looking information, and is for
illustrative purposes only and should not be relied upon as necessarily being indicative of future results. Dave’s independent registered public accounting firm did not audit, review, compile, or perform any procedures with respect to the projections for the purpose of their inclusion in this presentation, and
accordingly, it did not express an opinion or provide any other form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of this presentation. These projections should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results. Dave does not undertake any commitment to update or revise the projections,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
In this presentation, certain of the above-mentioned projected information has been repeated (in each case, with an indication that the information is an estimate and is subject to the qualifications presented herein), for purposes of providing comparisons with historical data. The assumptions and estimates
underlying the prospective financial information are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the prospective financial information. See
“Forward-Looking Statements” paragraph above. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the prospective results are indicative of the future performance of Dave or that actual results will not differ materially from those presented in the prospective financial information. Inclusion of the prospective financial
information in this presentation should not be regarded as a representation by any person that the results contained in the prospective financial information will be achieved.
INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA
In this presentation, Dave relies on and refers to information and statistics regarding the sectors in which Dave competes and other industry data. Dave obtained this information and statistics from third-party sources, including reports by market research firms. Although Dave believes these sources are reliable,
the Company has not independently verified the information and does not guarantee its accuracy and completeness. Dave has supplemented this information where necessary with information from discussions with Dave members and Dave’s own internal estimates, taking into account publicly available
information about other industry participants and Dave’s management’s best view as to information that is not publicly available.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The financial information and data contained in this presentation is unaudited and does not conform to Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Accordingly, such information and data may not be included in, may be adjusted in or may be presented differently in, any filing Dave
makes with the SEC.
This presentation contains references to Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, and adjusted net income per share (basic and diluted) of Dave, which are adjusted from results based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”)
and exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. The Company defines and calculates Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net income before the impact of interest income or expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and adjusted to exclude non-recurring legal settlement and litigation expenses,
stock-based compensation expense, account inactivity fees, gain on extinguishment of convertible debt, changes in fair value of earnout liability and changes in fair value of public and private warrant liabilities. The Company defines and calculates variable operating expenses as provision for credit losses,
processing and servicing costs and financial network and transaction costs. The Company defines and calculates non-variable operating expenses as all advertising and activation costs, compensation and benefits operating expenses, technology and infrastructure costs and other operating expenses
(administrative, legal, rent, depreciation, amortization, charitable contributions). The Company defines and calculates non-GAAP gross profit as GAAP operating revenues, net excluding variable operating expenses. The Company defines and calculates non-GAAP gross profit margin as non-GAAP gross profit as a
percentage of GAAP operating revenues, net. The Company defines and calculates adjusted net income as GAAP net income adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, account inactivity fees, the gain on extinguishment of convertible debt, the tax impact related to the gain on extinguishment of convertible
debt, the tax impact related to the release of the valuation allowance, non-recurring legal settlement and litigation expenses, changes in fair value of earnout liability and changes in fair value of public and private warrant liabilities. The Company defines and calculates non-GAAP adjusted net income per share -
basic and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share - diluted as adjusted net income divided by weighted average shares of common stock-basic and weighted average shares of common stock-diluted, respectively.
These non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to the user in assessing our operating performance and facilitates an alternative comparison amongst fiscal periods. The Company’s management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing performance, as well as in planning and forecasting
future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed according to GAAP and the methods the Company uses to compute them may differ from the methods used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental, should not be considered a substitute for financial information
presented in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Other companies may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, and therefore the non-GAAP measures of Dave included in this presentation may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

This presentation also contains trademarks, service marks and trade names of third parties, which are the property of their respective owners. The use or display of third

investments and optimizing new member MTM conversion.
In 3Q25, we acquired 843k new members, up 17% QoQ while
CAC was flat at $19 (CAC per new MTM decreased QoQ due to
improvements in new member conversion). We are
increasingly optimizing marketing spend across device
platforms and channels, prioritizing investments that yield the
highest projected gross profit dollar returns rather than the
lowest CAC. This recalibration, along with other improvements
to our unit economics, drove a 38% YoY increase in Gross
Profit per User and the associated improvements to LTV have
far outpaced changes to our CAC. Taken together, our cohort
returns are improving with payback periods down by nearly a

Solid engagement
Total Monthly Transacting Members (MMs)
Total MTM growth accelerated to 17% YoY as our product
and marketing initiatives have continued to drive
improvements in new member conversion and dormant
member reactivation. Notably, member retention on a
cohort basis has improved even as monetization increased
under our new fee model.
Total MTM growth also accelerated QoQ to 5% as
ExtraCash and Dave Card demand remained strong. We
believe continued optimization of our CashAITM
underwriting, our new fee model, and further adoption of
the Dave Card will help to support MTM growth going
forward.
We remain focused on converting new members into
MTMs, retaining and deepening engagement among our
existing MTM base, and continuing to realize the
reactivation potential of nearly 11mm non-transacting
members.

ExtraCash Origination Volume ($B)

We originated a record of over $2.0bn of ExtraCash in Q3.
We believe our ability to sustain growth in originations
demonstrates the depth and breadth of our TAM as well as
our core competency in addressing members’ needs for
short-term liquidity.
Originations grew 49% year over year, driven by 17% growth
in MTMs and 20% increase in average ExtraCash size,
reflecting expanded approval limits under our new fee
model, enhancements from CashAI™ v5.5, and the increasing
tenure of our member base.
$2.0bn of originations translated into a $268mm net
receivables balance as of 9/30/25. The ExtraCash product
structure allows us to serve a large number of MTMs without
the need for a capital-intensive balance sheet or taking
significant credit risk exposure at any one point in time.

Improving credit Quarterly Static Pool Delinquency and Charge-Off Rates(1)
performance
(2)
ExtraCash is powered by CashAI™, our proprietary underwriting engine that
performs real-time credit risk assessment through fully automated analysis of
bank transaction data. Leveraging over 160mm originations to date and a rapid
feedback loop, this short-duration product enables continuous model
optimization. This agile framework, in combination with ExtraCash’s primary use
cases in essential spending categories (e.g. gas, groceries, rent), gives us strong
confidence in our ability to manage credit risk across economic environments.
28 Day Delinquency rate improved 7 bps QoQ to 2.33% (Sept. rate was 2.19%),
reflecting initial benefits from CashAI v5.5 rollout in late Q3. 28 Day rate
increased 55 bps YoY, consistent with the deliberate underwriting recalibration
implemented alongside our new fee model to maximize gross profit.
We are introducing a 28 Days Past Due (DPD) rate, which will become our
primary delinquency metric in ‘26. This metric aligns more closely with industry
standards and eliminates distortion for members on monthly income cycles

| Improving credit
performance
ExtraCash is powered by CashAI™, our proprietary underwriting engine that
performs real-time credit risk assessment through fully automated analysis of
bank transaction data. Leveraging over 160mm originations to date and a rapid
feedback loop, this short-duration product enables continuous model
optimization. This agile framework, in combination with ExtraCash’s primary use
cases in essential spending categories (e.g. gas, groceries, rent), gives us strong
confidence in our ability to manage credit risk across economic environments.
28 Day Delinquency rate improved 7 bps QoQ to 2.33% (Sept. rate was 2.19%),
reflecting initial benefits from CashAI v5.5 rollout in late Q3. 28 Day rate
increased 55 bps YoY, consistent with the deliberate underwriting recalibration
implemented alongside our new fee model to maximize gross profit.
We are introducing a 28 Days Past Due (DPD) rate, which will become our
primary delinquency metric in ‘26. This metric aligns more closely with industry
standards and eliminates distortion for members on monthly income cycles
which are more common under v5.5. Q3 28 DPD rate was 2.15%(3), an
improvement of 11 bps (5%) QoQ, providing a clearer reflection of ongoing credit
improvement. In September, following the rollout of CashAI v5.5, the 28-Day DPD
rate improved further to 2.04%. We expect Q4 28 DPD to fall below 2.10%.
We expect continued improvement in credit performance as a result of v5.5,
which is trained on our new fee structure and leverages nearly twice as many AI

spend volumes
Our Dave Card strategy leverages our market-leading
ExtraCash value proposition to drive top-of-wallet
spending behavior and build long-term banking
relationships with our members.
Dave Card spend expanded 25% YoY and 3% QoQ driven
by growth in active banking customers, strong card spend
per active banking customer and continued synergy with
ExtraCash.
A significant portion of ExtraCash originations are
disbursed to the Dave Card, enhancing member
convenience, lowering member cost, and deepening
member engagement. Active Dave Card users exhibit
higher retention on ExtraCash and greater lifetime
value—benefiting from increased product stickiness and
the incremental ARPU.

● ~700 bps improvement in compensation expense,
highlighting the scalability of our business model and
the productivity gains resulting from our investments

$93.6mm of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities,

We remain on track to begin transitioning receivables under our new
