thus far in Q4. We are once again raising our 2025 guidance. Congratulations to our team on another tremendous quarter.”

Liquidity Summary
As of September 30, 2025, the Company had $93.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, investments, and restricted cash,
compared to $104.7 million as of June 30, 2025. The decrease was primarily attributable to the $25 million in share repurchases the Company
executed in Q3 as well as the increase in the ExtraCash receivables balance, partially offset by the Company’s free cash flow generation. The
Company did not increase utilization of its credit facility during the quarter.

Prior FY 2025 New FY 2025
GAAP Operating Revenues, Net $505 - $515 $544 - $547
Year-Over-Year Growth 46% - 48% 57% - 58%
Adjusted EBITDA* $180 - $190 $215 - $218
Year-Over-Year Growth 108% - 120% 149% - 152%
*Non-GAAP measure. The Company does not provide a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures because it is
unable to predict without unreasonable effort the exact amount or timing of the reconciling items, including interest expense, investment income, and
loss provision, among others. The variability of these items could have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results.
Dave’s CFO & COO, Kyle Beilman, commented: “Q3 results reflect the strength of our unit economics and the operating leverage embedded in our
business model. Year-over-year, the ExtraCash monetization rate has increased by over 70 bps, and after accounting for losses, the net monetization
rate is up 45 bps. Putting this together with the 20% increase in average origination size over the same period, net revenue per origination is up 32%.
At a portfolio level, we grew originations by nearly 50% year-over-year, exceeding over $2.0 billion for the first time, with ExtraCash Net Revenue
growing by 64%. Additionally, payback periods improved nearly a month to under four months, even at higher levels of marketing investment, reflecting
our focus on directing acquisition spend toward the highest gross profit opportunities.”
Beilman added, “This recalibration of our underwriting and acquisition strategies, coupled with our disciplined management of fixed costs, resulted in
85% flow-through to Adjusted EBITDA. This across-the-board execution supported a 1,200 basis point expansion in Adjusted EBITDA margin to
nearly 40% and positions us well to continue scaling efficiently and driving highly profitable growth for years to come.”

United States (“GAAP”) and exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. The Company defines and calculates Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net income
before the impact of interest income or expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and adjusted to exclude non-recurring
legal settlement and litigation expenses, stock-based compensation expense, account inactivity fees, gain on extinguishment of convertible debt,
changes in fair value of earnout liability and changes in fair value of public and private warrant liabilities. The Company defines and calculates variable
operating expenses as provision for credit losses, processing and servicing costs and financial network and transaction costs. The Company defines
and calculates non-variable operating expenses as all advertising and activation costs, compensation and benefits operating expenses, technology
and infrastructure costs and other operating expenses (administrative, legal, rent, depreciation, amortization, charitable contributions). The Company
defines and calculates non-GAAP gross profit as GAAP operating revenues, net excluding variable operating expenses. The Company defines and
calculates non-GAAP gross profit margin as non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of GAAP operating revenues, net. The Company defines and
calculates adjusted net income as GAAP net income adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, account inactivity fees, the gain on
extinguishment of convertible debt, the tax impact related to the gain on extinguishment of convertible debt, non-recurring legal settlement and
litigation expenses, the tax impact related to the release of the valuation allowance, changes in fair value of earnout liability and changes in fair value
of public and private warrant liabilities. The Company defines and calculates non-GAAP adjusted net income per share - basic and non-GAAP
adjusted net income per share - diluted as adjusted net income divided by weighted average shares of common stock-basic and weighted average
shares of common stock-diluted, respectively.
These non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to the user in assessing our operating performance and facilitate an alternative comparison
among fiscal periods. The Company’s management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing performance, as well as in planning
and forecasting future periods. The methods the Company uses to compute these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the methods used by
other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in
accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Refer to the section further below for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024.
