# **CS Lumber Co., Ltd. \- FY2025 Financial Results Presentation**

**Speaker:** Representative Director and President, Mr. Nakai **Date:** \[Date of Recording\]

### **Introduction**

Thank you very much for your continued support. I am Nakai from CS Lumber Co., Ltd.

Thank you very much for taking time out of your busy schedules today to attend our financial results briefing. There may be parts that are difficult to hear, but I hope you will watch until the end.

Since there may be some of you attending for the first time, I would like to start by briefly explaining our company's overview. Please look at **page 3**.

Our company is a company that provides "Total Services" related to wooden construction, centered in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Our business content consists of four businesses: the **Precut Business**, **Construction Contracting Business**, **Real Estate Leasing Business**, and **Real Estate Sales Business**.

regarding our company's history, please look at **page 4**. Originally, our company operated as a general lumber retailer, but in 1991 (Heisei 3), we started the lumber Precut business and transformed our business format into a manufacturing industry. This has become the driving force for our growth today.

Subsequently, we steadily advanced as a total service company for wooden construction, including the construction of wooden houses and entry into the 2x4 (two-by-four) business. We are currently listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Standard Market.

### **FY2025 Financial Results (Year Ended May 2025\)**

Continuing on, I will explain the financial results for the fiscal year ended May 2025\. Please look at **page 6**.

As for the financial summary for the fiscal year ended May 2025, primarily due to the downturn in the Precut business, both net sales and profits decreased.

* **Net Sales:** 20.673 billion yen (down 2.2% year-on-year)  
* **Operating Profit:** 1.68 billion yen (down 19.3% year-on-year)  
* **Ordinary Profit:** 1.57 billion yen (down 19.3% year-on-year)  
* **Net Income for the Period:** 1.157 billion yen (down 19.3% year-on-year)

While the Precut business saw severe results in both sales and profit, the Construction Contracting business achieved a double-digit increase in both revenue and profit due to area expansion in Kanagawa Prefecture and the Jonan district of Tokyo, as well as the completion of highly profitable large-scale wooden facilities.

The Real Estate Leasing business also saw a double-digit increase in revenue and profit due to increased rental income from the acquisition of new properties.

Next, regarding quarterly business performance trends, please look at **page 7**. This is a graph of net sales and operating profit on a quarterly basis. The area enclosed in red on the right is the actual result for the fiscal year ended May 2025\.

In the first quarter, we saw a significant decrease in revenue and profit due to order competition with competitors. From the second quarter onwards, we thoroughly strengthened our sales capabilities, promoted the so-called "integrated inventory" (providing construction materials and framing construction as a set), and expanded the area for construction contracting work. As a result, the green bar graph for net sales has maintained a generally flat trend.

On the other hand, the orange line represents the trend in operating profit. While there were improvements in profitability in the Construction Contracting business and increased rental income from property acquisitions in the Real Estate Leasing business, the slump in precut sales prices continues, and we believe that improving profit margins alongside increasing shipment volumes remains a challenge.

### **Segment Information**

Next is the situation by segment. Please look at **page 8**.

First, regarding our core **Precut Business**: As shown in the graph on the left, net sales decreased by 1.128 billion yen from 16.378 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 15.249 billion yen this fiscal year. Segment profit also decreased by 539 million yen, dropping from 1.284 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 745 million yen.

Against the backdrop of a decrease in the number of new housing starts and intensified order competition, factors such as a decrease in shipment volume and stagnation in sales prices contributed to this. However, we will carry out activities with a stronger commitment to shipment volume and profit margins than ever before through new customer development and providing integrated inventory.

Continuing with the **Construction Contracting Business**, please look at **page 9**. For the Construction Contracting business, net sales increased by 761 million yen over the previous year to 5.17 billion yen. Segment profit also saw a significant increase of 67 million yen, reaching 369 million yen. In terms of growth rate, this is a significant increase of \+17.3% in net sales and \+22.2% in segment profit year-on-year.

Regarding net sales, in addition to striving to strengthen sales to existing clients and develop new clients and improve profitability at the time of order intake, orders also expanded in Kanagawa Prefecture and the Jonan district of Tokyo. Furthermore, regarding the soaring construction costs seen recently, the demand to build large-scale facilities with relatively inexpensive wood has steadily increased. By prioritizing profitability in tackling such projects, this led to increased revenue and profit.

Next is the **Real Estate Leasing Business**. Please look at **page 10**. As for the Real Estate Leasing business, as shown in the graph on the left, net sales for the fiscal year ending May 2025 were 1.123 billion yen, an increase of 206 million yen over the previous year. Segment profit also increased by 100 million yen to 579 million yen.

In the fiscal year ending May 2025, we newly acquired rental properties and apartment buildings, bringing our holdings to 55 properties. We have secured stable rental income by combining this with the rent from existing properties. The acquired rental properties are carefully selected profitable properties, taking into consideration living environments and convenience, such as proximity to stations and residential areas, so that they can be utilized as land for future detached house sales or condominium sales.

### **Financial Analysis**

Next is the increase/decrease in **Operating Profit**. Please look at **page 11**. The graph shows the factors contributing to the increase/decrease of the operating profit of 1.774 billion yen for the fiscal year ending May 2025 compared to the same period of the previous year.

The main factors for the decrease were a decrease of 509 million yen in the Precut business and an increase of 80 million yen in personnel expenses. Factors for increase were an increase of 79 million yen in the Construction Contracting business and an increase of 101 million yen in the Real Estate Leasing business. The overall decrease in profit is largely due to the downturn in the Precut business.

Continuing to **page 12**. This is a comparison of the **Balance Sheet** with the end of the previous fiscal year. Tangible fixed assets, enclosed in red on the left, increased by 3.452 billion yen, which is due to the new acquisition of rental properties in the Real Estate Leasing business. Long-term debt, enclosed in red on the right, increased by 2.637 billion yen, which is due to the procurement of funds for property acquisitions. On the other hand, short-term debt, enclosed in blue above that, decreased by 618 million yen from the previous year, as debts other than those for property acquisition funds are being compressed.

Finally, **Cash Flow** on **page 13**. Cash flow from operating activities increased by 2.155 billion yen due to the acquisition of profit. As a result, the operating cash flow margin was 10.4%, an increase of 0.9 points over the previous year. Cash flow from investing activities decreased by 5.547 billion yen due to the acquisition of rental properties and the accumulation of surplus funds. Cash flow from financing activities increased by 1.585 billion yen due to fund procurement at the time of rental property acquisition. As a result, the balance of cash and equivalents at the end of the period decreased by 1.81 billion yen compared to the end of the previous fiscal year, to 3.311 billion yen.

### **FY2026 Forecast (Year Ending May 2026\)**

Next, I will explain the earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending May 2026\. Please look at **page 15**.

regarding the fiscal year ending May 2026, there is no change in the premise that the trend of decreasing new housing starts and order competition with other companies in the same industry will continue. On the other hand, due to full-scale entry into the siding (exterior wall) precut business and sales activities using integrated inventory, we project net sales for the fiscal year ending May 2026 to be 22.1 billion yen, a 6.9% increase over the previous year. Also, operating profit is projected at 1.7 billion yen, and the operating profit margin is planned at 7.6%.

As priority measures for this term, in addition to focusing on the siding precut business, we will continue to put effort into increasing orders through integrated inventory sales and continue the acquisition of profitable rental properties.

Regarding the forecast for net sales and operating profit, please look at **page 16**. The trends for net sales and operating profit are as shown in the graph. In each graph, the lighter color represents the first half and the darker color represents the full year. For the fiscal year ending May 2026, as explained earlier, we expect net sales to increase by 6.9% year-on-year to 22.1 billion yen. Regarding operating profit, we anticipate a 1.4% increase year-on-year to 1.8 billion yen.

Regarding the earnings forecast by segment, please look at **page 17**. In the fiscal year ending May 2026, by segment, the Precut business is expected to see a slight increase in net sales compared to the previous year at 16.3 billion yen, but we will strengthen efforts to improve profit margins. The Construction Contracting business and Real Estate Leasing business are expected to exceed the previous year, and the Other Real Estate Sales business recorded a loss in the previous term but is planned to return to profitability.

The Precut business faces declining lumber prices and price competition with competitors, but we believe that providing precut to customers at appropriate prices in line with lumber price fluctuations will lead to customer trust and satisfaction, and consequently to the sustainable growth of our company.

Please look at **page 18**. The Precut business will expand its business scope through inventory by introducing craftsmen for foundation, framing, and interiors to business partners who are short of craftsmen and unable to make arrangements. Also, in the logistics department, we will promote low-cost afternoon flights (Gogo-bin) and the 7-ton loading of the 4-ton trucks known as "Zoton-sha" (increased tonnage vehicles) to improve delivery efficiency.

The Construction Contracting business will actively work on large-scale wooden facilities in addition to increasing the number of detached houses. The Real Estate Leasing business will continue to aggressively invest in high-yield properties in station-front areas centered on Chiba City as candidates for future detached houses and condominiums. In the Real Estate Sales business, we will strengthen cooperation with local real estate companies and carry out sales of 30 lots.

### **Mid-Term Management Plan**

Next, I would like to explain the results of the "Mid-Term Management Plan 2025" and the outline of the "New Mid-Term Management Plan 2028". First, I will explain the overview of "CS Lumber Vision 2032". Please look at **page 20**.

In aiming for our company's future vision for the 50th term in 2032, we worked on the "Mid-Term Management Plan 2025" with the goal of strengthening the revenue base of each business and strengthening the financial base in the first three years. May 2025 was the final year of that first three-year period.

I will explain the numerical targets of the "New Mid-Term Management Plan" later, but the basic concept of the "Mid-Term Management Plan 2028" is to make inventory-based precut sales and the Real Estate Leasing business the two pillars of Japan. Please look at **page 21**.

"Vision 2032" sets forth the goal of becoming a corporate group that continues to expand and grow businesses while creating diverse revenue sources through ingenuity, without being bound by the framework of the precut business while using it as a base. We are fully committed to promoting the idea that all employees should be able to embody "ingenuity" in our corporate culture.

Please look at **page 22**. Toward the future vision of 2032, we will solve issues through ingenuity to stabilize management and strengthen each business. Without being bound by the framework of existing businesses, we will maximize the synergy effect between CS Lumber Group companies and work as one across the company.

Next, I will explain the results of the "Mid-Term Management Plan 2025". Please look at **page 23**. For the three years of the previous Mid-Term Management Plan, in addition to the decrease in housing starts exceeding expectations, the management targets and initial forecasts were met in terms of net sales and recurring profit due to the intensification of price competition with competitors. regarding the revised forecast, while net sales were achieved, recurring profit was met.

Next, regarding the status of major KPIs, please look at **page 24**. Regarding the number of precut units (tsubo), securing appropriate profits was considered the primary goal, and as a result of tackling this, it fell short due to the impact of intensified price competition with other companies. Regarding the number of construction units, it fell short due to delays in securing personnel, but we have already prepared the personnel structure, and we expect the number of units to increase from this term onwards. The number of owned trucks fell short, but we have introduced increased tonnage vehicles equivalent to two trucks, so practically we have achieved it. In construction and tourism, we have newly established the Kamata base and are expanding sales to Kanagawa Prefecture and the Jonan area of Tokyo. In addition, the large-scale wooden facility opened in April with a size exceeding 1,000 tsubo, and we will utilize the accumulated construction know-how to strengthen our initiatives.

Rental properties have steadily increased the resilience system to secure a stable stock business, resulting in a result that significantly exceeded the initial plan.

Please look at **page 25**. Real estate investment has become an investment amount that exceeds the initial plan by actively implementing it while observing the internal level of investment yield. Purchased rental properties are invested in by narrowing down to high-quality locations in station areas that can be sold as future detached houses or condominium subdivision sites if the occupancy rate drops significantly due to age deterioration or other reasons.

Also, regarding human resource development, we implemented internal training considering the inheritance of business know-how accumulated with the company's management philosophy and the implementation of training inviting external lecturers for the next generation of management candidates.

Continuing to **page 26**. Regarding the strengthening of the financial base, we have strived to proceed as planned. Interest-bearing debt has been repaid by 10.04 billion yen over three years, and the loan balance is 9.956 billion yen. Rental income from real estate has increased to about 1.2 billion yen annually at present, securing stable revenue, and we will implement investment in rental properties and loan repayment in a well-balanced manner to make our financial structure solid. Note that the balance of interest-bearing debt of about 9.9 billion yen is mostly loans for acquiring rental properties, and it is a plan to repay based on rental income, so it is not something that affects the main business of the precut business.

Continuing, I will explain the numerical targets for the "Mid-Term Management Plan 2028". Please look at **page 27**. We will work on the Real Estate Leasing business as a pillar of Japan for the next three years as a stable revenue source along with precut sales based on inventory. Specific numerical targets include net sales of 27.6 billion yen, ordinary profit of 2.7 billion yen or more, and an ordinary profit margin of 10% or more.

Also, regarding the strengthening of the financial base, the nursery school loan was already paid off ahead of schedule in May 2024\. Going forward, we will proceed with the repayment of loans systematically while continuing real estate rental investment.

Please look at **page 28**. The Precut business is expected to see a further decline in housing starts due to population decline, and competition with other companies is expected to intensify further in a severe market environment. However, we will secure an appropriate profit margin through sales methods based on inventory and work on it.

The Construction Contracting business will increase tourism numbers by strengthening proposal capabilities and expanding new channels to real estate companies and builders. We will also appeal the construction results of large-scale projects exceeding 1,000 tsubo and increase the number of non-residential contracts.

Please look at **page 29**. The Real Estate Leasing business has secured two nursery school properties scheduled to open next spring. Residence-based rental properties will actively invest in properties that can be future detached house and condominium subdivision sites as high-quality areas in station areas centered on Chiba City. In new businesses, we will fully materialize the siding exterior material precut for which preparations were advanced from the previous term.

Please look at **page 30**. As Konosuke Matsushita, who was said to be the god of management, said, "Business is people," our company will also put effort into securing human resources and education that can become future management teams. Also, we will expand the place for female employees and people with disabilities to play an active role.

Regarding preparations for various risks, we will also strengthen the management system.

Please look at **page 31**. Regarding investment in real estate, we will continue to actively implement it while observing internal regulations regarding investment yield. For securing master carpenters, which is the key to inventory and sales systems, we will conduct securing and fostering by utilizing various channels. We aim to improve the productivity of precut factories and boldly challenge unmanned operation during processing times.

Please look at **page 32**. Regarding the dividend policy, we have made it a basic policy to implement it according to business performance considering the continuity and safety of dividends. Since the number of new housing starts due to population decline is expected to decrease, and relying on debt repayment, unmanning of precut processing machines, securing stable revenue sources, etc., we consider focusing on investment in the rental business as a basic policy, and consider surplus funds as resources.

We aim for a dividend payout ratio of 20% at the stage where continuous business expansion is expected in the future.

That concludes the explanation. Since these are reference materials, please look through them when you have time. Thank you very much for listening for a long time.

### **Q\&A Session**

**Moderator:** Thank you very much. We will now move on to the Q\&A session. We have received questions via text, so I will read them out. Please provide your answers.

**Question 1:** The decline in profit margin of the Precut business continues. Please tell us about the measures to stop the bleeding.

**Mr. Nakai:** Yes. This is different from other companies, as our company is very particular about stopping bleeding, and we would like to further refine that. For that purpose, purchase of materials, or procurement, is everything, so we would like to pour our efforts thoroughly into procurement.

**Moderator:** Thank you. We have received one more question via text.

**Question 2:** In the medium to long term, to what extent do you think you will increase the revenue ratio of non-precut businesses such as real estate leasing?

**Mr. Nakai:** Yes. It is inevitable that the number of housing starts will decrease due to population decline. Therefore, if the Precut business does not grow as expected, we plan to expand the leasing business accordingly. Eventually, we would like to expand it to a level equal to the Precut business.

**Moderator:** With that, we will conclude the CS Lumber Co., Ltd. financial results briefing for the fiscal year ended May 2025\. Thank you very much for joining us today amidst your busy schedules.
