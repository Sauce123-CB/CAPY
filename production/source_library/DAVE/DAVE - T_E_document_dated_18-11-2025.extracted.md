Q3 2025 Earnings Call
(Corrected version)
Summary NEW
Key Takeaways
The Dave Inc. Q3 2025 earnings call highlighted record revenue growth, driven by increases in monthly transacting members (MTMs) and ARPU, as well as strong adjusted EBITDA performance and upward revisions to
the company's full-year guidance. Management emphasized the importance of net credit revenue and the positive impact of their new pricing model and CashAI v5.5. They also discussed strategic growth pillars,
including efficient member acquisition, strengthening member engagement through credit and Dave Card, and operational updates regarding Coastal Community Bank and the appointment of a new Chief Product
Officer.
Q & A Highlights
The earnings call Q&A session focused on key areas including delinquency rates and the impact of CashAI v5.5, consumer trends, customer acquisition costs, the Coastal Community Bank transition, executive
deliverables, operating leverage, buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) opportunities, Dave Card adoption, ExtraCash product approval rates, updated 2025 guidance, monthly transacting members (MTMs), the
subscription fee change, and the average ExtraCash advance size. Analysts sought clarity on these topics to better understand the company's performance, strategy, and future outlook.
Delinquency Rates and CashAI v5.5
• Q: What specific qualitative or quantitative aspects of CashAI v5.5 allow you to outperform in the delinquency category?
• A: The amount of inputs in the CashAI model that stemmed from customers' cash flow data is massive. CashAI v5.5 factors in 200 more variables and is married with super short duration cycles, leading to superior credit
performance. This gives confidence that credit is an input to the model, not an output, and the company is very in control of loss rates.
Consumer Trends
• Q: What trends are you currently observing among consumers, considering the short duration of your book?
• A: The company tracks a proprietary index built using cash flow data and is seeing normalcy across spend, income, and merchant types. The consumer at this end of the spectrum on the K-curve looks very healthy. This is
reflected in the stability of the CAC at $19, which is flat sequentially, but down on an MTM basis due to better conversion as a result of new improvements in CashAI.
Customer Acquisition Cost
• Q: As we look at Q4, do you expect customer acquisition cost to remain stable, or do you anticipate higher spend to take advantage of consumers?
• A: The company largely expects things to look pretty consistent in Q4 as they did in Q3. Q4 is more of a peak season from an overall market spend perspective, so CPMs do rise, and the company tries to match its spend to
the most opportunistic points of the calendar where it can really optimize that spend from a CPM perspective. By and large, the company would expect CAC and overall levels of media spend to be pretty consistent in Q4.
Coastal Community Bank Transition
• Q: When do you anticipate the complete transition of Coastal on the balance sheet, and the balance will look very different?
• A: All new customers are now onboarding onto the bank, and the company is going to begin the process of transitioning existing customers imminently, and expects that to be completed in early 2026. The transition of the
balance sheet will be a fast follow to that, targeting end of first quarter, early second quarter, for the full migration of the funding arrangement with Coastal. The company thinks it's going to be a super attractive outcome
and free up a lot of cash to pursue more strategic capital allocation opportunities.
Executive Deliverables
• Q: What are the deliverables for Parker in the first 24 to 36 months at Dave?
• A: The company is excited to have Parker come in and accelerate product velocity. He's seen some of the best companies in the world at scale, and the company thinks it can benefit from some of these new opportunities,
such as the buy-now-pay-later product. The company is excited about his ability to deliver on long-term product roadmap, credit performance, as well as just bringing in a high performing team as well.
Operating Leverage
• Q: As you think about where this model can go, how do you think about where this company can be over the next few years as you expand? Is there more room from here, or is this kind of the right place
to be where you can balance both that growth investment and and growth really?
• A: The company likes where it's at from an overall margin perspective, from EBITDA margin perspective specifically. The company thinks there's a sort of nice balance between delivering significant profitability, but also
giving the opportunity to invest in some more R&D to deliver these new products. The company is excited about these new opportunities, and that is going to come along with a little bit more investments and resources to
make sure that the company can fully execute on those opportunities. The margin profile here is something that the company is quite happy with, and would like to make further investments to set the company up for its
next phase of growth.
Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) Opportunities
• Q: How much does your existing business model and ExtraCash product, and just the data you have on your customers, give you an advantage, you feel like, in the marketplace? Meaning, you have the
opportunity to potentially provide this product to customers that are already using a buy-now-pay-later product, but you did have an informational advantage as well other - relative to some of the other
products out there. Just curious, kind of like, how you think about it? And then also, if you kind of have a sense of how many of your current customers are using some type of buy-now-pay-later product
already?
• A: Roughly 60% of the company's members are currently engaging in some form of a BNPL transaction today, which is a significant opportunity, and which Dave has 0% market share. The company feels like it can really
differentiate with its cash flow and CashAI underwriting, given it will be the only BNPL company in leveraging cash flow data. The company feels like the ability to use CashAI to approve more people and increase limits is a
real advantage. The company believes that letting people have the opportunity to BNPL whatever they want, is a huge opportunity where the company sees a lot of friction with people having to select a e-commerce
merchant and figure out who's going to be at checkout when you go shopping, versus just paying to have the flexibility to shop in BNPL anywhere is a great opportunity and the company thinks unique to the market.
Dave Card Adoption
• Q: How did adoption trend in Q3, and what percentage of your member base now has the Dave Card?
• A: The company did see a 25% growth in Q3, spend at about $510 million now, which the company felt very good about the growth there. There continues to be a lot of synergy between ExtraCash origination growth and
growth of Dave Card, given people can access ExtraCash instantly and cheaper by using the card. It is a significant amount of customers using the Dave Card. The company doesn't need to win direct deposit for its
business to work, and very much views the Dave Card to be incremental to customer retention and lifetime value. The company is going to continue to chip away at new product ideas to win more there, but feels like the
moat it's really developed is around CashAI and the underwriting, and the road map is more heavily focused on credit expansion versus direct deposit penetration.
ExtraCash Product Approval Rates
• Q: Did you disclose what the approval rate was in Q3, and how it is trending so far in Q4?

## Page 2 of 15

• A: The company doesn't discuss approval rates, but did note that its approval rate is at all-time highs, which is driving efficiencies in its total MTM conversion. The CAC is stable at $19, but the company did allude to MTM
CAC being down. It also leads to faster paybacks, but offsetting sub-four months for the first time in probably the life of the business.
Updated 2025 Guidance
• Q: On the updated 2025 guidance, when we look at the implied guide for Q4, you're raising the fourth quarter revenue guide up versus the prior. Do you mind talking about what motivated the increase
in the guide? Maybe talk about what you're seeing with MTMs and ARPU, or by product with ExtraCash, et cetera, that might have been different versus where things stood three months ago? Any extra
details on what's motivating the change in the guidance for revenue would be great. And do you have any early thoughts on how the revenue might look for 2026?
• A: MTMs are accelerating and ARPU is expanding. Basically, all aspects of the growth model are firing on all cylinders right now, and the company has just a lot of optimism about the trajectory of the business, and is seeing
that reflected in the revised guidance. There is no major difference in terms of where the company is at now, necessarily, versus last quarter, it's just more of a continuation of the trends that the company has been seeing
over the last year plus now where, again, MTMs are trending very favorably and ARPU is expanding rapidly, and that's supporting the top line growth. The unit economics are improving based on the new underwriting
paradigm that the company is in with the higher gross spreads and net yields that the company is seeing within the portfolio and all that's just flowing down through to the bottom line. The company has not provided, or
will not be providing any specific color around 2026. Overall, the company's view is just that this is a very, very big market that it's serving, and likes to think that it can continue to grow MTMs as it serves that market over
time. From an ARPU perspective, the company is very early on from what it ultimately wants to shift to this customer from a product perspective, and that should lead to additional ARPU growth over time. The company
views that growth algorithm for the business is very durable and that there is still a lot of upside from here for it to drive growth over the next several years.
Monthly Transacting Members (MTMs)
• Q: Do you mind digging in a little more in terms of where you're finding new MTMs right now? Walk us through where the new 200,000 MTMs are coming from. It would be great if you could help us
understand that. And then also, when we compare MTMs versus your total members, that's up about 20%. That's been pretty consistent over the past several quarters. I guess my question is, do you
think there's opportunity to drive greater conversion of your total members to become monthly transactors? Or is that low 20-ish percent sort of the right way to think about it going forward? How do
you see that playing out from here?
• A: The company feels very good about the total conversion of its entire base, which is over 13 million now, being a pool which it can continue to push fish from to convert more customers. The 2.77 million MTMs the
company just reported on, are not the same 2.77 million every single quarter, it is people that come in and out of that total 13 million. The company is still continuing to drive more strategies to convert more people, and
hopefully, can increase that 20% penetration rate over time. The company is just continuing to see a lot of efficiencies in the existing marketing channels. Word of mouth is still very strong at a third of the company's
acquisition, and is seeing a lot of pocket of growth within television, which the company thinks is a very challenging channel to scale for most companies, and Dave has found a lot of ways to unlock that, which the company
thinks is a real testament to its brand and the very strong message it can go to market with. The rest of the company's channels continue to perform well across social, digital streaming. It's sort of business as usual with no
meaningful concentration in any one channel, which gives the company a lot of confidence into 2026 and beyond. The company is just seeing much stronger conversion at the front door as a result of CashAI
improvements, and that's another way for it to help insulate CAC sensitivities moving forward is just further improvements to conversion.
Subscription Fee Change
• Q: Just to be clear, this monthly subscription fee change for $3, that's for new members who are accessing the ExtraCash advance option. It's not just for new members who sign up?
• A: That's correct, it's actually for new MTMs that the company converts, and existing members at the $1 have been grandfathered in. The company still has to be able to convert more of those people to a higher subscription
revenue over time, but didn't want to rock the boat on retention or conversion, so just focused on the new customers which will continue to grow.
ExtraCash Advance and Dave Card
• Q: With the ExtraCash advance and the Dave Card, can you talk about how that has changed over the last year in terms of members putting their ExtraCash advance on Dave Card?
• A: About 30% of total customers are sending ExtraCash to the Dave Card, and that's been pretty consistent over time. The company is looking for more ways to improve that, but views the Dave Card as a way to drive
incremental retention of its members, and it continues to trend nicely with ExtraCash origination growth.
New Product - BNPL
• Q: In terms of new products, you've been talking about BNPL in particular, have you developing that product? You have it in beta? Where are you and what are your thoughts on introducing it into the
market?
• A: The company is with internal testing with a handful of employees, as of now, and expects to have customers start testing the product in the first quarter. Depending on what the company sees and likes in the conversion
and the loss rate performance will determine the pace at which it ramps that product next year.
Average ExtraCash Advance Size
• Q: With regard to the average ExtraCash advance size, it nudged up from $206 to $207 between the second quarter and the third quarter. And you noted that it increased to $213 in September. Where
could that figure go over time? What are you comfortable with in terms of the rate at which the average loan size increases? How do you see that increasing organically just with the evolution of the
platform?
• A: The company expects to continue to sort of chip away at that average origination size over time, and does see that to continue to be a source of ARPU expansion under the new pricing model moving forward. The
company saw a nice lift there in September, as a result of the underwriting changes with CashAI v5.5, and there are certainly additional model optimizations that the company is working on right now that it thinks will be
additive to average origination size. There is also a dynamic where in Q3 the company's proportion of new customers was larger than Q2, just by virtue of marketing spend and the conversion benefits that it's talked about,
that creates a little bit of a short-term headwind on average origination sizes. New customers approval limits are lower than the average book, but sort of as that normalizes, the company would expect that also be just a
sort of average kind of limit increases as well. As the company's base becomes more and more

year-over-year to $150.8 million. Accelerated growth in monthly transacting members 17% to 2.77 million,
expanded ARPU by nearly 40% and generated $58.7 million of adjusted EBITDA, all in service of our strategy
to maximize gross profit dollars across the platform. Given our strong performance and clear momentum in
the business, we are pleased to once again raise our 2025 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, which Kyle
will touch on shortly.
Before reviewing our strategic growth pillars, I'd like to make a few quick points I want every investor to take
away from the call today. First, the importance of net credit revenue. Following last quarter's record results,
we received a number of questions around delinquency metrics and loss provision trends. I want to clarify
how we think about those dynamics. To fully understand our economics, we are laser focused on the net
monetization rate per ExtraCash transaction, calculated as gross yield less 121-day losses and net revenue
per transaction. On those measures, we achieved record performance in Q2, and built upon that
momentum with new all-time highs in Q3. These are the metrics that drive gross profit and cash flow, and
led us to another quarter of record profits.
Second, our new pricing is driving better credit economics, despite controlled slightly higher loss rates.
Earlier this year, we made a significant change in our pricing model, moving customers from an optional fee
model to a mandatory one. The result was greater credit revenue retention, as customers stay on our
platform, resulting in better portfolio spreads. The larger and more predictable monetization rates gave
us an opportunity to increase approval limits for new and existing customers, which helps with both
conversion and monetization. These higher limits led to a controlled step up in loss rates, as the impact
was far outweighed by the gains we achieved in incremental gross spreads. The net result is better net
monetization per transaction, higher member lifetime value, and stronger economics for the company
while supporting better offers for our customers, a win-win.
Third, CashAI v5.5 has started to deliver. We expect continued improvements in credit performance as a
result of the rollout of CashAI v5.5 in late Q3. CashAI v5.5, the latest evolution of our proprietary underwriting
engine, was trained on our new fee structure and leveraged nearly twice as many AI-driven features as the
prior version. CashAI v5.5 has driven stronger conversion, higher approval amounts, and improved credit
outcomes in September, and thus far in Q4, positioning us for further expansion in ExtraCash gross profit,
and revenue net of losses.
Lastly, we'll be adding a section on our IR site highlighting how Dave thinks about credit performance, which
will hopefully provide clarity for our stakeholders moving forward.
Now, to turn to a few highlights from our strategic pillars.
Starting with our first strategic growth pillar of efficient member acquisition. While CAC per new member
remained stable quarter-over-quarter at $19, CAC per new MTM declined given the improvements we've
made to new member conversion. We are increasingly optimizing our marketing investments by device and
channel, prioritizing investments that yield the highest gross profit return, rather than the lowest CAC. The
higher LTVs we are generating under the new fee and subscription model have further accelerated our
gross profit payback periods by nearly a month year-over-year now under four months.

Moving to our second strategic pillar of further strengthening engagement with our members through
credit, ExtraCash originations grew 49% year-over-year, surpassing $2 billion for the first time as a result of
MTM growth and a 20% growth in average origination size. The growth in origination size reflects a modest
impact from CashAI v5.5, which enables us to offer higher approval amounts. In September, which captured
most of the CashAI v5.5 impact, the average ExtraCash size was $213, which we believe positions us well for
continued origination growth and monetization gains in Q4 and beyond.
The third strategic pillar of our strategy, is deepening engagement and monetization through Dave Card. In
Q3, total card spend grew 25% year-over-year to $510 million, reflecting growth in MTMs and increases in
card spend per active banking customer. High margin subscription revenue grew 57% year-over-year as we
completed the rollout of a $3 monthly subscription fee for new members in late Q2. We expect the
incremental subscription revenue to flow entirely to the bottom line, with little to no impact on member
conversion or retention. Existing MTMs remain grandfathered for now, and we expect subscription revenue
to become an increasing contributor in the quarters ahead as more MTMs are acquired under the new
monthly pricing structure.
Lastly, I'd like to provide two operational updates. First, on Coastal Community Bank, which is assuming bank
sponsorship for Dave ExtraCash and banking products from our existing provider. In early Q3, we began
onboarding new members onto Coastal, and reached full onboarding for all new members in early Q4. Over
the coming months, we'll begin migrating existing members to Coastal as well.
That brings me to our second update. We're thrilled to welcome Parker Barrile as our Chief Product Officer.
Parker will lead the next chapter of our product strategy, focused on deepening member engagement
through new product developments, and strengthening our AI and credit capabilities.
To wrap things up before passing to Kyle, this was another incredible quarter for us. We are really excited
and optimistic about our future, and what we can deliver in the years ahead. Over to you, Kyle.
Kyle Beilman
Thanks, Jason. And good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to focus on the core drivers of this quarter's
performance, a concise overview of credit, and our updated outlook. For a more detailed review and
discussion of our KPIs, please refer to our earnings supplement available on our IR site.
Let's get started with the key trends and achievements that shaped our results. Our growth algorithm
continues to strengthen. We accelerated MTM growth through successful product and marketing
initiatives that drove higher conversion rates and member reactivation, while retention has remained
been consistent. On the ARPU side of the equation, underwriting improvements combined with a new pricing
model to drive higher ExtraCash offers, consistent growth of Dave Card spending volume, as well as the
growing population of members on our new subscription price point were the key factors driving growth.
Combined, we grew revenue by more than 60% for the second consecutive quarter. And with our
growing operating leverage, achieved nearly 40% EBITDA margins exceeding the Rule of 100 for the second
consecutive quarter.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | continues to strengthen |  |  | . | We accelerated MTM growth through successful product and marketing |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | initiatives that drove higher conversion rates and member reactivation |  |  |  |  |  |  | , while retention has remained |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | been consistent. |  | On the ARPU side of the equation, underwriting improvements combined with a new pricing |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | model to drive higher ExtraCash offers, consistent growth of |  |  |  |  | Dave | Card spending volume, as well as the |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | growing population of members on our new subscription price point were the key factors driving growth. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Combined, | we grew revenue by more than 60% for the second consecutive quarter |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | . | And with our |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | growing operating leverage, achieved nearly 40% EBITDA margins exceeding the Rule of 100 for the second |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

As Jason previously alluded to, our credit performance demonstrates the strong fundamentals
underlying our growth. We've set new high watermarks across unit level net monetization rates, total unit
dollar net monetization, and portfolio net revenue. Importantly, we achieved these improvements while
growing originations by nearly 50% in the quarter, demonstrating our improved unit economics and
volume growth are working in concert to drive gross profit expansion.
A key driver of this growth is the new pricing model and underwriting paradigm that we transitioned to
earlier this year. This new model generates significantly higher gross spreads and broader approval
sizes for members. This change increases credit losses relative to our prior approach, however, the
incremental gross spread more than offsets these losses, delivering superior net monetization per
transaction, which was the intended outcome of this strategic shift. To put the impact in perspective, year-
over-year the total monetization rate net of losses, and net revenue per ExtraCash transaction net of
losses, are up 45 basis points and 32% respectively.
In terms of delinquency rate, our Q3 28-day delinquency rate improved 7 basis points sequentially to
2.33%. In September, our 28-day delinquency rate was 2.19%, reflecting the initial benefits from our new
underwriting model, CashAI v5.5. As a reminder, the 28-day delinquency rate measures the percentage of the
calendar month's originations that remain outstanding 28 days after the month's end, not necessarily those
that are delinquent. As currently defined, the 28-day delinquency rate can be noisy, particularly when the
portfolio composition shifts. This recently happened as part of the CashAI v5.5 model change, where we
intentionally increased the limits for members on monthly income cycles, such as Social Security recipients.
To provide a clear picture that controls for these duration dynamics, we are introducing a 28-day Days Past
Due, or DPD metric. For now, we will continue to publish both metrics to track early indicators of the loss
outcomes of each of our quarterly vintages. In Q3, the 28-day DPD improved 11 basis points sequentially to
2.15%. And in September, following the CashAI v5.5 rollout, the DPD rate improved to 2.04%, with further
improvements to net revenue per transaction and monetization rate net of losses. These signals reinforce our
confidence in the upgrades from the new model, and support our expectation for further improvements in
credit performance during Q4.
Another important point to call out, is around the provision. In addition to growth in the originations and
the sequential improvement in credit performance, a portion of the change in the Q3 provision was
attributable to quarter end timing. Q3 ended on a Tuesday, which is the high point of intra-week receivables,
definitionally increasing the reserve calculation, and thereby increasing the provision. If Q3 ended on a
Monday, consistent with last quarter, the provision would have been roughly $2 million lower. This timing
effect is separate from the improvements in economics we're seeing, which, as I previously described, are
very strong. Looking ahead, we expect the provision expense as a percentage of originations to improve in
Q4, supported by both continued improvement in credit performance and a more favorable quarter end
calendar with Q4 closing on a Wednesday.
Working down the P&L a bit. We grew non-GAAP gross profit by 62% year-over-year to $104.2 million. Non-
GAAP gross margin came in at 69% for Q3, consistent with our target range of high 60s to low 70s for periods
outside of the Q1 tax season.
With respect to expenses, as we previewed on the Q2 call, we increased marketing spend to take advantage
of the favorable LTV to CACs that we're generating from our media spend to drive additional growth. We
expect to sustain the rough magnitude of the Q3 spend through year end.

On the fixed cost base, there are also a few noteworthy items to call out. Compensation-related expenses
declined 18% year-over-year, driven primarily by lower stock-based compensation. In Q3 of last year, there
was elevated stock-based compensation tied to performance-based restricted stock units linked to adjusted
EBITDA targets that were achieved. Excluding stock-based compensation, compensation-related expenses
grew by roughly 3% year-over-year. Other operating expenses increased 5% year-over-year, excluding the
impact of non-recurring legal settlement charges. Also, a $4.5 million legal settlement charge this quarter has
been excluded from adjusted EBITDA.
Taking all this together, GAAP net income increased to $92 million, up $91.5 million year-over-year. This
increase includes a $33.6 million income tax benefit, primarily related to the release of a valuation allowance
on our deferred tax assets. Adjusted net income, which excludes non-recurring items, stock-based
compensation, and non-cash fair value adjustments, increased 193% year-over-year to $61.6 million.
Similarly, adjusted EBITDA reached $58.7 million, growing 137% year-over-year, with 85% flow through
from gross profit.
One other brief update before turning to guidance. Regarding our new funding arrangement with Coastal
Community Bank, we remain on track to begin transitioning ExtraCash receivables under the new off-balance
sheet structure in early 2026. This change is expected to meaningfully reduce our direct funding
obligations, lower our cost of capital, and unlock substantial liquidity to pursue capital allocation
opportunities. It will also allow us to fully retire our existing warehouse debt facility by mid-2026.
With that, let's turn to the guidance.
Based on our Q3 results and favorable outlook, we are once again raising our 2025 outlook. We expect
revenue to range from $544 million to $547 million, and adjusted EBITDA to range from $215 million to $218
million. This revised outlook reflects not only the tailwinds from the new fee model and underwriting
improvements we've achieved, which significantly increased net monetization per transaction, but also
the fact that all aspects of our growth strategy are performing exceptionally well. Monthly transacting
members are accelerating, ARPU is rising, and overall market demand and conditions are favorable, all key
building blocks supporting our optimistic outlook.
And with that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line for questions.

Thank you. We will now begin our question and answer session. And our first question will come from Jacob
Stephan from Lake Street Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Analyst:Jacob Stephan
Question – Jacob Stephan: Hey, guys. Appreciate you taking the questions. Great quarter here. Maybe you
could kind of start off talking a little bit about delinquency rates. Obviously, we saw 28-day delinquencies
drop. What is it specifically, kind of, about CashAI v5.5 either qualitative or quantitatively that you guys are
able to kind of outperform in this category?

Answer – Jason Wilk: Yeah. Hey, Jacob, good morning. So, with CashAI, as we've talked about extensively, the
amount of inputs we have in that model that stemmed from our customers' cash flow data is just a massive
data that we have. And we factor in CashAI v5.5, which has 200 more variables input in there, and we marry
that with the super short duration cycles that we're able to learn from, that leads to just superior credit
performance and gives us a lot of confidence that credit is an input to our model, not an output and the
company is very in control of our loss rates.
Question – Jacob Stephan: Got it. And maybe you could just kind of touch on some of the broader consumer
trends. Obviously, you guys have a pretty significant lead on several other loan providers, but maybe you
could just kind of talk to the shortness – the duration, the short duration of your book? And what trends are
you seeing in consumers currently?
Answer – Jason Wilk: Well, we do track a proprietary index we've built using the cash flow data we have
access to. And for all intents and purposes, we're seeing normalcy across spend, income, merchant types. So,
the consumer at this end of the spectrum on the K-curve, looks very healthy in our opinion. And I think
where you can see a lot of that show up is just in the stableness of our CAC at $19, which is flat sequentially.
But importantly, it's down if you look at it on an MTM basis, which we're able to leverage better conversion as
a result of new improvements in CashAI to get better approvals for customers as they enter in the front door,
which is a great trade-off for us. But, I think, we're seeing everything be very healthy for the business.
Question – Jacob Stephan: Okay. And maybe just kind of one last one, as we look at Q4 here, help us think
through, kind of, customer acquisition cost. Do you kind of expect it to remain stable? Or do you have higher
spend in Q4 to take advantage of some of these consumers?
Answer – Kyle Beilman: Hey, Jacob. It's Kyle. Good morning. So, in terms of CAC and spend, we largely
expect things to look pretty consistent in Q4 as they did in Q3. Q4 is more of a peak season from an overall
market spend perspective. So, CPMs do rise, and we try to, sort of, match our spend to the most
opportunistic points of the calendar where we can really optimize that spend from a CPM perspective. But, by
and large, I would expect CAC and overall levels of media spend to be pretty consistent in Q4.
Question – Jacob Stephan: Okay. Very helpful. Nice quarter, guys.
Answer – Kyle Beilman: Thanks so much.
Answer – Jason Wilk: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question will come from Hal Goetsch from B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.
Analyst:Harold Lee Goetsch
Question – Harold Lee Goetsch: Hey. Great quarter, guys. Just terrific, terrific execution. Wanted to ask about
the transition of Coastal on the balance sheet. When do you think it will be like a complete transition, and the
balance will look very different? The second part would be, could you tell us a little bit about the deliverables
for your new executive hire and product? Thanks.

Answer – Kyle Beilman: So, just to start with the balance sheet question, Hal, we are in the process of the
Coastal migration. I think, as we talked about on the call, all new customers are now onboarding onto the
bank, and we're going to begin the process of transitioning existing customers here imminently, and we
would expect that to be completed in early 2026. And the transition of the balance sheet will be a fast follow
to that. And so targeting end of first quarter, early second quarter, I think is a good timeline for us to make
that full migration of the funding arrangement with Coastal. But yeah, we're looking forward to that. We
think it's going to be a super attractive outcome for us as we've talked about, and free up a lot of cash for
us to pursue more strategic capital allocation opportunities. But Jason, do you want to take the question
about Parker?
Answer – Jason Wilk: Sorry, what was the question about Parker, Hal?
Question – Harold Lee Goetsch: Yeah. What are the deliverables for Parker in the first 24 months to 36
months at Dave that we can just – for our own edification? Thanks.
Answer – Jason Wilk: Well, see, we're excited to have Parker come in and accelerate product velocity. And
he's seen some of the best companies in the world at scale, and we think we can benefit from some of
these new opportunities we have coming out, such as the buy-now-pay-later product we've talked quite a
bit about. We're excited to get him in and see. He's got a fantastic executive presence and we're excited about
his ability to deliver on long-term product roadmap, credit performance, as well as just bringing in a high
performing team as well.
Question – Harold Lee Goetsch: All right. Okay, thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question will come from Devin Ryan from Citizens Bank. Please go ahead.
Analyst:Devin Ryan
Question – Devin Ryan: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Great quarter. Just want to touch on operating
leverage and just where you guys are right now? Obviously, putting up tremendous results and
tremendous kind of operating leverage in the business model here at and your roughly 40% EBITDA
margin. So, as you think about kind of where this model can go, I appreciate you're going to be going into
some new product areas and there are some growth investment, and at the same time you can kind of toggle
marketing. But, how do you think about where this company can be over the next few years as you expand?
Is there more room from here? Or is this kind of the right place to be where you can balance both that
growth investment and and growth really?
Answer – Kyle Beilman: Hey, Devin, good morning. Thanks for joining. I think by and large, we like where
we're at from an overall margin perspective, from EBITDA margin perspective specifically. And we think
there's a sort of nice balance between delivering significant profitability, but also giving us the
opportunity to invest in some more R&D to deliver these new products that Jason was alluding to that Parker
will going to be obviously a very critical component of delivering.
Yeah, look, I think we are excited about these new opportunities, and that is going to come along with a little
bit more investments and resources to make sure that we can, yeah, fully execute on those opportunities. So,
we're super excited about that. But yeah, I mean, just to answer the question, I think the margin profile here

is something that we're quite happy with, and we'd like to make further investments to set the company up
for its next phase of growth.
Question – Devin Ryan: Got it. Thank you. And a follow up on the buy-now-pay-later opportunity. Appreciate,
we're still kind of early days there, but how much does, kind of, your existing business model and ExtraCash
product, and just the data you have on your customers, give you an advantage, you feel like, in the
marketplace? Meaning, you have the opportunity to potentially provide this product to customers that are
already using a buy-now-pay-later product, but you did have an informational advantage as well other –
relative to some of the other products out there. Just curious, kind of like, how you think about it? And then
also, if you kind of have a sense of how many of your current customers are using some type of buy-now-pay-
later product already?
Answer – Jason Wilk: Yeah. Thanks a lot, Devin. So, I'd say there's three points. So, to answer your last
question, we do see in our transaction data, which is a huge advantage, that roughly 60% of our members
are currently engaging in some form of a BNPL transaction today, which is a significant opportunity, and
which Dave has 0% market share and a space we thought we have a very strong right to play in.
Second, we feel like we can really differentiate with our cash flow and CashAI underwriting, given we are – we
will be the only BNPL company in leveraging cash flow data. If you think about traditional BNPL, the
merchant checkout, there'd be too much friction to try to get someone to connect a bank account there. And
so, most of these guys are still leveraging alternative bureau underwriting approach to assess the customer.
And we feel like ability to use CashAI to approve more people and increase limits is a real advantage for us.
And then lastly, we believe that letting people have the opportunity to BNPL whatever they want, is a huge
opportunity where we see a lot of friction with people having to select a e-commerce merchant and figure
out who's going to be at checkout when you go shopping, versus just paying to have the flexibility to shop in
BNPL anywhere is a great opportunity and we think unique to the market.
Question – Devin Ryan: That's great. Appreciate the color. Thanks, guys.
Answer – Jason Wilk: Yeah.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question will be from Joe Vafi from Canaccord. Please go ahead.
Unidentified speaker
Question – Unidentified speaker: Good morning. This is (00:40:16) on for Joe. Thanks for taking the
questions. I have two quick ones here. First one, maybe on the Dave Card. How did adoption trend in Q3? And
what percentage of your member base now has the Dave Card?
Answer – Jason Wilk: So, we did see a 25% growth in Q3, spend at about $510 million now, which we felt
very good about the growth there. Continues to be a lot of synergy between ExtraCash origination growth
and growth of Dave Card, given people can access ExtraCash instantly and cheaper by using our card. As far
as what percentage of our customers are using the Dave Card, it is a significant amount. We don't disclose
that today, but we do disclose the total transaction volume, again which is at $510 million number.

I think it's important to point out, we don't need to win direct deposit for our business to work. We very much
view the Dave Card to be incremental to customer retention and lifetime value. And we're going to continue
to chip away at new product ideas to win more there, but we feel like the moat we've really developed is
around CashAI and the underwriting, and our road map is more heavily focused on credit expansion versus
direct deposit penetration.

Question – Unidentified speaker: That's great. Thanks, Jason. And one on the ExtraCash product, did you
disclose what the approval rate was in Q3, and how it is trending so far in Q4?
Answer – Jason Wilk: We don't discuss approval rates, but we did note that our approval rate is at all-time
highs, which is driving efficiencies in our total MTM conversion. Our CAC is stable at $19, but we did allude
to MTM CAC being down. Not a number we do disclose, but an important health metric that allows us to be
more scalable and leads to more profitability. And also leads to faster paybacks, but offsetting sub-four
months for the first time in probably the life of the business.

Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Cantwell from Seaport Research. Please go ahead.
Analyst:Jeff Cantwell
Question – Jeff Cantwell: Hey, thanks. On the updated 2025 guidance, when we look at the implied guide for
Q4, you're raising the fourth quarter revenue guide up versus the prior. Do you mind talking about what
motivated the increase in the guide? Maybe talk about what you're seeing with MTMs and ARPU, or by
product (00:30:22) with ExtraCash, et cetera, that might have been different versus where things stood three
months ago? Any extra details on what's motivating the change in the guidance for revenue would be great.
And do you have any early thoughts on how the revenue might look for 2026? I'm curious if you could give us
an early read on next year, if at all possible. Thanks.
Answer – Kyle Beilman: Hey, Jeff. Good morning. So, in terms of the guidance, look, we have obviously one
fewer quarter with the annual guide this period versus to last, obviously. But I think just taking a step back as
we talked about on the call, MTMs are accelerating – MTM growth is accelerating, ARPU is expanding.
Basically, all aspects of the growth model are firing on all cylinders right now. And I think we have just a lot
of optimism about the trajectory of the business, and I think you're seeing that reflected in the revised
guidance.
So, I would say no major difference in terms of where we're at now, necessarily, versus last quarter. It's just
more of a continuation of the trends that we've been seeing over the last year plus now where, again, MTMs
are trending very favorably and ARPU is expanding rapidly, and that's supporting the top line growth. As

we've talked about, the unit economics are improving based on the new underwriting paradigm that we're
in with the higher gross spreads and net yields that we're seeing within the portfolio and all that's just
flowing down through to the bottom line. So, that's really what's showing up in the guide.
We have not provided, or we'll not be providing any specific color around 2026. I mean, overall, our view is
just that this is a very, very big market that we're serving, and we like to think that we can continue to grow
MTMs as we serve that market over time. And that from an ARPU perspective, we are very early on from what
we ultimately want to shift to this customer from a product perspective, and that should lead to additional
ARPU growth over time. So, we view that growth algorithm for the business is very durable and that
there is still a lot of upside from here for us to drive growth over the next several years.
Question – Jeff Cantwell: Got it. That's helpful. And then, on your monthly transacting members, that's now
2.8 million this quarter. That's up sequentially (00:32:51) versus last year. Do you mind digging in a little
more in terms of where you're finding new MTMs right now? Walk us through where the new 200,000 MTMs
are coming from. It would be great if you could help us understand that. And then also, when we compare
MTMs versus your total members, that's up about 20%. That's been pretty consistent over the past several
quarters. I guess my question is, do you think there's opportunity to drive greater conversion of your total
members to become monthly transactors? Or is that low 20-ish percent sort of the right way to think about it
going forward? How do you see that playing out from here? Thanks.
Answer – Jason Wilk: I'd say the total conversion of our entire base, which is over 13 million now, we feel
very good about that being a pool which we can continue to push fish from to convert more customers. The
2.77 million MTMs we just reported on, are not the same 2.77 million every single quarter. It is people that
come in and out of that total 13 million. So, we're still continuing to drive more strategies to convert more
people, and hopefully, we can increase that 20% penetration rate over time.
As far as the new MTMS, we're just continuing to see a lot of efficiencies in the existing marketing channels.
Word of mouth is still very strong at a third of our acquisition, and we're seeing a lot of pocket of growth
within television, which we think is a very challenging channel to scale for most companies, and Dave has
found a lot of ways to unlock that, which I think is a real testament to our brand and the very strong message
we can go to market with. And the rest of our channels continue to perform well across social, digital
streaming. So it's sort of business as usual with no meaningful concentration in any one channel, which gives
us a lot of confidence into 2026 and beyond.
And as you talked about, I think, you mentioned conversion, we're just seeing much stronger conversion
at the front door as a result of CashAI improvements, and that's another way for us to help insulate CAC
sensitivities moving forward is just further improvements to conversion.
Question – Jeff Cantwell: Okay, great. Thanks very much.

Answer – Jason Wilk: Great. Doing well. How are you?
Question – Gary Frank Prestopino: Great, thank you. Couple of questions here. Just for my sake, just to be
clear, this monthly subscription fee change for $3, that's for new members who are accessing the ExtraCash
advance option. It's not just for new members who sign up?
Answer – Jason Wilk: That's correct. It's actually for new MTMs that we convert, that's how to think about
that number, and existing members at the $1 have been grandfathered in. Still have to be able to convert
more of those people to a higher subscription revenue over time, but we didn't want to rock the boat on
retention or conversion, so we just focused on the new customers which will continue to grow.
Question – Gary Frank Prestopino: Okay. And then, could you – and some other question alluded to this
with the ExtraCash advance and the Dave Card, can you – if you don't give that conversion publicly, could you
talk about how that has changed over the last year in terms of members putting their ExtraCash advance on
Dave Card?
Answer – Jason Wilk: We have said about 30% of total customers are sending ExtraCash to the Dave Card.
That's been pretty consistent over time. Looking for more ways to improve that. That's been a pretty steady
state conversion we've seen, and are happy where that's – again, we view the Dave Card as a way to drive
incremental retention of our members, and it continues to trend nicely with ExtraCash origination growth.
Question – Gary Frank Prestopino: Okay. That's great. Thanks. And then, in terms of new products, you've
been talking about BNPL in particular, have you developing that product? You have it in beta? Where are you
and what are your thoughts on introducing it into the market?
Answer – Jason Wilk: We are with internal testing with a handful of employees, as of now. And so, excited to
hit that milestone, and expect to have customers start testing the product in the first quarter. And
depending on what we see and like in the conversion and the loss rate performance will determine the pace
at which we ramp that product next year.
Question – Gary Frank Prestopino: Okay. Thank you.

The next question will be from Mark Palmer from Benchmark. Please go ahead.
Analyst:Mark Palmer
Question – Mark Palmer: Yes, good morning. With regard to the average ExtraCash advance size, it nudged
up from $206 to $207 between the second quarter and the third quarter. And you noted that it increased to
$213 in September. Where could that figure go over time? What are you comfortable with in terms of the rate
at which the average loan size increases? How do you see that increasing organically just with the evolution
of the platform? Thank you.
Answer – Jason Wilk: Hey, Mark, good morning. Look, I think we expect to continue to sort of chip away at
that average origination size over time. I think, if you rewind back to over the last year or two, you've seen
sort of steady progress against that metric. And we do see that to continue to be a source of ARPU expansion

under the new pricing model moving forward. We saw a nice lift there in September, as a result of the
underwriting changes with CashAI v5.5, and there are certainly additional model optimizations that we're
working on right now that we think will be additive to average origination size.
There is also a dynamic where in Q3 our proportion of new customers was larger than Q2, just by virtue of
marketing spend and the conversion benefits that we've talked about, that creates a little bit of a short-
term headwind on average origination sizes. Because, you can just imagine, new customers approval
limits are lower than the average book, but sort of as that normalizes, I would expect that also be just a sort
of average kind of limit increases as well.
And then in terms of just tailwinds, as our base becomes more and more seasoned, our average tenure of an
MTM ticks up over time, that is also a source of origination size expansion. If you look at our average
customer tenure of an MTM, it's close to two years at this point, which is up pretty significantly on a – if you
look back at over the last couple of years. And so, as we do better at retention and reactivation, that is also,
again, a source of upside to the average origination number – size number.
But look, I think, it is a fair thing to say that that number can't continue to grow into perpetuity, and if we
want to get into other types of product categories to give our customers a little bit more flexibility around
duration, hence the BNPL offering that we're super excited about to support those additional credit use
cases. But yeah, I'd say over that near to medium term, very optimistic that we can continue to chip away at
that origination size number.
Question – Mark Palmer: Thanks very much.

The next question will be from Zachary Gunn from FT Partners. Please go ahead.
Analyst:Zachary Gunn
Question – Zachary Gunn: Hey, there. Thanks for taking my question. So, I know this isn't disclosed
specifically, but if I back out subscription revenue, and really look at the processing revenue, the yield on
that as a percentage of origination volume has been steadily going up, and it continued to do so this
quarter. Can you just talk about what's driving that increase in the yield, and should we expect that to settle,
continue to kind of increase, or just what's driving that? Thanks.
Answer – Jason Wilk: Largely the changes to the gross revenue yield, if you want to think about it as a, sort
of, service revenue as a percentage of overall originations, has come from the pricing model change. Now
that that's more or less worked its way through system, I would expect that to stabilize around that number
that you're seeing today. But yeah, I'd say that increase over the last couple of quarters really a result of
the pricing evolution that we undertook in Q1.
Question – Zachary Gunn: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow up, when you have loans off
balance sheet, can you just remind us, walk us through the economics, what the moving pieces will be in
terms of accounting for credit losses or anything else we should be aware of?
Answer – Kyle Beilman: Yeah. So basically, how it's going to work is, our receivables – a large portion of our
receivables are going to sit with the bank at Coastal. And so, the funding obligations from us will be

drastically reduced. We will still have full economic exposure to the underlying assets, we're just going to
basically be paying the bank for access to their balance sheet. So from a provision and overall accounting
perspective on the P&L in particular, there won't be any real change. It should be very consistent. We'll
continue to report out on the same metrics that we do currently. It's really just the fact that our balance sheet
will reflect the fact that our receivables will be sitting at the bank, and that we won't have any debt
obligations on the balance sheet with respect to the credit facility there. So, from a net cash perspective, net
cash would go up significantly as we make that transition.
