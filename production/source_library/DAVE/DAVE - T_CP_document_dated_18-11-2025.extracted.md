Q & A Highlights
The analyst's questions primarily revolved around Dave's business model, focusing on the ExtraCash product, customer acquisition costs (CAC), and revenue generation strategies. The analyst also probed into the
expansion of Dave's credit algorithms, pricing strategies, and the potential of the BNPL market. Furthermore, the discussion covered Dave's competitive advantages against traditional banks and its plans for future
product development and balance sheet management.
Dave's Business Model and Value Proposition
• Q: Can you introduce Dave, its value proposition, and why it is resonating so much with consumers these days?
• A: Dave has been around since 2017. The name stands for Dave versus Goliath, going up against major banks and their predatory overdraft and minimum balance fees. The company is one of the fastest-growing
neobanks, with over 12 million consumers and nearly 3 million monthly transacting members. In Q2, revenue was up over 60% at $131 million, with EBITDA up close to 300% at over $50 million. Dave stands out by

starting the customer journey with access to consumer credit, using cash flow data to underwrite consumers for inexpensive credit instead of overdraft fees. Consumers can access up to $500 of credit within five minutes of
downloading the app, with no interest, late fees, or credit check, and a CAC under $20 to open a new checking account.
ExtraCash Product and Underwriting
• Q: Can you explain how you underwrite ExtraCash so well while exploiting a big demand market?
• A: Dave uses a customer's cash flow data, accessed through Plaid, to feed its AI model called CashAI. CashAI looks at 0.5 billion transactions to find commonalities of risk, such as when you get paid, where you work, the
types of ATMs you go to, and who you send money to. These risk signals are more indicative of assessing risk for small-dollar credit than credit scores. Dave has issued ExtraCash over 150 million times, continuously
pushing loss rates down to record low levels. The company is doing about $1.8 billion of originations per quarter, and loss rates are nearly 1%.
• Q: Have you been able to offer an increased size of ExtraCash, and not only have the loss rates come down?
• A: CashAI has been improving over time, leading to an increase in average originations per user by over 40% year-over-year, with loss rates decreasing significantly. The company charges a transparent 5% fee for access to
the money, capped at $15 per origination and a minimum of $5. This is compared to banks like JPMorgan or Wells Fargo, which charge $34 every time you overdraft your account.
• Q: Even though the loss rates are good, are you still moving forward with expanding your credit algo?
• A: Dave introduced a new pricing scheme last year, mostly monetizing ExtraCash through optional fees, where customers paid what they thought was fair. After issuing the product 120 million times, the company
determined that people were willing to pay around 5% per transaction. Moving to a mandatory fee structure has improved monetization, with average revenue per user growing over 40% year-over-year. The company has
also felt more comfortable increasing loss rates slightly to maximize gross profit, which led to record EBITDA growth.
• Q: You're still clearly operating within the band of loss rates that you feel comfortable with, right?
• A: The loss rates on a 120-day basis are nearly 1%, and the spreads are over 6% on a gross basis, resulting in a fantastic net spread. The company has a lot of room to adjust loss rates if desired and feels good about the
current position as a new baseline for optimization. This is based on the new monetization working well and the AI model optimizing origination against gross profit output.
Customer Acquisition and Revenue Growth
• Q: You still have a very attractive customer acquisition cost metric, right? And I believe in the quarter, you might have even improved the payback period on that. Is that correct? So, you're printing
money, do you think you should accelerate your CAC or your spend on customer ac here because you're doing so well, or is it, do you think the model is kind of fine-tuned where it should be here?
• A: Paybacks are at an all-time low, with customer acquisition costs paid back on a gross basis in four months. There was only a $1 increase in CAC sequentially despite increased marketing spend, and almost 800,000 new
members were acquired in the quarter. The company is making rapid strides in ARPU growth and LTV expansion and feels no need to rush growth.
• Q: You're putting in a new change in your pricing for new members, right? You're increasing the monthly subscription fee from $1 to $3, maybe just kind of dig in a little bit on why you feel comfortable
with that new pricing model there?
• A: Since 2017, Dave has had a $1 per month subscription fee and has been testing an increase over the last six months to measure conversion and retention impact. The value offered to customers has increased over time,
not commensurate with the subscription fee charged. Rigorous testing for six months landed on a $3 monthly price point for new customers with no impact to conversion or retention. This has helped impact faster payback,
as it's effectively a 100% gross margin product. The company did not increase pricing for existing customers yet but reserves the right to do so over time.
• Q: Interchange is growing, but like the rocket fuel these days is ExtraCash growth, right? Is that fair to say?
• A: It's ExtraCash growth and subscription revenue growth as well.
Dave Debit Card and BNPL Product
• Q: Where are you in the journey of exploiting those cash advances in ExtraCash to move that to Dave debit or debit card and drive even higher interchange there like where are the pieces that you can
work on from here to make sure that money is going to the Dave card and not somewhere else?
• A: It's not a requirement for people to bank with Dave, which separates it from companies like Chime, which requires a direct deposit to get any access to value. Dave offers credit within minutes of joining by linking an
existing bank account. The TAM of people willing to connect a bank account for access to services is far larger than those willing to switch their entire banking life to get access to credit. This shows up in the CAC, with
Dave's CAC being $18 versus Chime at well over $100 for the same account sign-ups. Every customer that signs up is signing up for a full-on checking account with Dave, and the company incentivizes people to trial the
Dave card by giving them a discount on ExtraCash. Customers save money by using the card, which drives about 30% of originations from ExtraCash onto the Dave debit card. The company is also building a new type of
BNPL credit card-type product to give customers another opportunity to access credit instantly, giving a little bit more duration. The goal is to be top-of-wallet, regardless of whether customers have direct deposit with
Dave.
• Q: Do we have an idea when that's going to hit the market - I mean, you must be testing and figuring some things out on it now?
• A: Testing will begin with friends and family in Q4, with a stretch goal of testing with new customers in the fourth quarter as well. This will go through a rigorous review process to test the efficacy of CashAI underwriting
from ExtraCash onto this new product, which extends the duration to 30 to 60 days. Over half of Dave's users are engaging with BNPL in some form, and Dave has a zero percent market share.
• Q: If you do roll that out, it's a little longer duration. I know you also switched your bank partner, right? Who may put some of their balance sheet to work on some of your loan portfolio, or do you think
your balance sheet can handle the new product as well as the existing product, or you have to think about that a little bit?
• A: The new credit product will also be a very short-duration product. The new banking partner, Coastal Community Bank, will be the issuing bank of this new credit product and is already originating all of Dave's ExtraCash
loans. They will hold those loans through to maturity, effectively giving Dave no balance sheet and zero debt. This will unlock over $100 million of net cash for the business that is currently being tied up in receivables.
• Q: Does that change your economics on ExtraCash if they're holding the loans on their balance sheet?
• A: It doesn't change the economics. The cost of funding on this new facility is roughly 200 basis points lower than the previous off-balance sheet facility with Victory Park. In the new model, Coastal will likely fund 100% of
the originations.
• Q: Are you currently doing like virtual NFC? If they want to sign up for your debit card, they can just tap on their phone pretty quick, or do you still have to get the physical card?
• A: Customers can provision to Apple or Google wallet within seconds of joining. The Dave checking account is a full-service checking account with 50,000 free ATMs in the network.
Competitive Advantages
• Q: So why - I mean, maybe it's a stupid question. So, you're kind of disrupting big banks a little bit here not only - why aren't - do you think they make more money in overdraft still versus kind of
changing their model and providing a service to you?
• A: Big banks are disadvantaged because their cost structure is so high that they are largely unprofitable for customers making under $100,000 a year who don't have credit cards or a mortgage. It costs big banks $300 a
year just to service a basic checking account, so they recoup costs through heavy overdraft fees. Dave is entirely digital-first, with no bank branches, and uses AI throughout the business. Dave services 3 million users of 12
million total registered customers with only 300 employees. The company's margins are over 70% with a product that's 90% cheaper than big banks.
Share Repurchase Authorization
• Q: Oh, I didn't see it yet.
• A: Dave announced a share repurchase authorization of up to an additional $125 million. The company feels that investors missed the narrative that Dave is well in control of loss rates and has an unparalleled data set with
very fast payback.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Joseph Vafi
All right. We're going to continue here at the 45th Annual Canaccord Growth Conference. I'm Joe Vafi, equity
research analyst here at Canaccord, focused on fintech. And up next, we are pleased to have with us again
Jason Wilk, who is the CEO of Dave.
So, across our fintech coverage, I think Dave has clearly been a standout in terms of growth and margin
expansion over the last couple – over the last year, clearly knocking the ball off – knocking the cover off the
ball compared to a lot of players in fintech these days.
So, Dave is an innovative fintech focused on providing a differentiated set of financial services, which helps
level the playing field for all Americans. Dave provides a great banking app which has no minimum balance,
no overdraft fees and modest-sized cash advances. The company also helps members build its credit and
even supply them or help them find gig opportunities. The company's ExtraCash product has really
resonated with consumers here over the last year, and we'll be focusing on ExtraCash here a little bit.
So, with that, welcome, Jason.
Jason Wilk
Thanks, Joe. Good to see you.
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Analyst:Joseph Vafi
Question – Joseph Vafi: So, maybe we just start off super high level, introduce Dave to us, the value
proposition and kind of why you are resonating so much with consumers these days?
Answer – Jason Wilk: Yeah. So, Dave's been around since 2017. The back story of the name stands for Dave
versus Goliath. We're going up against the major banks and all the predatory overdraft fees and
minimum balance fees they're charging. The company's one of the fastest growing neobanks in the world.
We have over 12 million consumers at this point, nearly 3 million monthly transacting members that are
paying us some sort of a fee in a given month.
The company has just been on absolute tear. We printed our Q2 earnings recently. Revenue is up over 60%,
$131 million, with EBITDA up over close to 300% at north of $50 million for the quarter. So, we're just feeling
great about the business, the trajectory and we're playing in a massive TAM here with underserved
Americans that are overpaying for fees, for access to basic banking services and also overpaying for access of
basic credit.
Where Dave really stands out between our competition like Chime or Cash App, we really start our customer
journey with access to consumer credit. Dave was the first company to use cash flow data to underwrite
consumers for inexpensive credit in lieu of expensive overdraft fees. And so, our average consumer can come
to Dave within five minutes of downloading our app and have access to up to $500 of credit to buy gas or

groceries. No interest, no late fees, no credit check. And that happens to be a fantastic way to go to market
with our CAC being under $20 to open up a new checking account.
Question – Joseph Vafi: Right. That's great. And that's the ExtraCash product. And I think you found a big,
big source of demand out there but you are able to underwrite it very profitably. You mentioned the cash
flow characteristics. Maybe just double click on that a little bit to kind of explain a little bit how you can
underwrite that well and while at the same time exploiting a big demand market?
Answer – Jason Wilk: Sure. So, I mean when I was going through college myself, happened to get hit with
quite a few overdraft fees. That always angered – anger me. I never understood why banks have to charge
such high fees for what is a very low-risk transaction in my opinion.
So, Dave was the first company to take a customer's cash flow data. We work with a company called Plaid to
give us instant access to consumers' checking account data. We take that information to feed our AI model.
We call it CashAI. That's looking at a 0.5 billion transactions amongst our customer base to find
commonalities of risk. When you get paid, where you work, the types of ATMs you go to, who you send
money to. All these risk signals we thought were much more indicative of assessing risk for small dollar credit
versus credit scores which are more indicative of whether you can pay a mortgage or a credit card bill. So, we
really invented this new underwriting system that better serves paycheck to paycheck Americans. And we're
doing about $1.8 billion of originations per quarter, and our loss rates are nearly 1%.
When we flashback to when we started the business, our loss rates were nearly 20%. So, it's not an easy thing
to do to try and invent your own credit scoring system (00:12:12) today we've issued ExtraCash over 150
million unique times and that feeding our AI model has been able to continuously push our loss rates down
to record low levels.
Question – Joseph Vafi: And not only the loss rates coming down, but you have been able to actually also
offer increased size of the ExtraCash?
Answer – Jason Wilk: Yeah. That's important to note. I mean, most companies who try and drive lower loss
rates tend to pull back on their credit limits. I mean, we've had the opposite effect where CashAI has been
getting better over time. Our average originations per user is up, I believe, over 40% year-over-year. And loss
rates have come down significantly over the past several years. I think until this most recent quarter, we've
had loss rates going down seven consecutive quarters with origination sizes going up. And how we make
money in that product is a very transparent and simple model where we're effectively charging a 5% fee for
access to the money with a cap of $15 per origination and a minimum of $5.
And so, when you think about our product in comparison to a JPMorgan or Wells Fargo, they're charging you
$34 every time you overdraft your account. That could be for a $5 cup of coffee. With Dave, you're borrowing
$100 and it's only costing you $5. It's a very transparent amount of money. Customers know what they're
approved for every time they log into the app. And it's a very simple experience where they can send the
money to their Dave card for free instantly and spend the money with us. But they can also send the money
out to an external account as well and add it to their own funds to pay their rent or bills.
Question – Joseph Vafi: And just kind of staying on that, the credit side for a second, you're also expanding
your credit algo, right?
Answer – Jason Wilk: Yes.

Question – Joseph Vafi: Materially, right?
Answer – Jason Wilk: Yeah, yeah. So I think...
Question – Joseph Vafi: Even though the loss rates are good, you're still moving forward with it? Yeah.
Answer – Jason Wilk: That's right. I mean, we actually introduced a new pricing scheme last year where we
were mostly monetizing our ExtraCash through optional fees. Dave was sort of a pioneer and letting
customers pay what they thought was fair for access to the feature. And after issuing the product 120 million
times, we kind of knew exactly what people are willing to pay and that ended up around that 5% per
transaction fee. Where we found with the optional fee structure is the higher we got customers up on the
limit curve, their willingness to pay us optional fees went down.
And so, moving to a mandatory fee structure last year has really changed the game in terms of our ability to
monetize. So, we've seen our average revenue per user grow over 40% year-over-year since we've
changed our fee structure and because we've seen our spreads increase so massively, we've also felt
more comfortable bringing up our loss rates a little bit to maximize for gross profit.
And so, I think it was actually a big miss with investors this quarter who sold off our stock thinking our loss
rates are going up and it's some negative consumer trend. It's actually the opposite, I mean, Dave, because
the duration of our ExtraCash solution is so short-term, average duration being about eight days. And if you
pair that with the fact we have AI analyzing 0.5 billion transactions on top of 150 million unique credit
originations, we're a very much in control of our loss rate scenario.
And so, we brought loss rates up just by 6%, which helped us maximize gross profit and that led to record
EBITDA growth. And so, we think it was a major oversight from the passive investors that didn't really spend
time reading through the script and understanding exactly the strings we pulled to deliver such a great
quarter.
Question – Joseph Vafi: Right. Yeah. I think, I mean, you're still clearly operating within the band of loss rates
that you feel comfortable with, right?
Answer – Jason Wilk: Oh, without a doubt. I mean, our loss rates on 120-day basis are nearly 1% our average
monetization (00:15:57) our spreads are over 6% on a gross basis. So, our net spread is fantastic. And when
you combine that with our short duration, it's an amazing business. And we have a lot of room to run on loss
rates should we want to bring them up. But we feel very good about where we're at this point. I think it's a
new sort of baseline for us of which to optimize from. And that's all based on the new monetization working
so well and our AI model really trying to find the most optimum way to drive the right level of origination
against gross profit output.
Question – Joseph Vafi: Right. And so, your revenue model kind of works and growth of monthly active users
combined with volume per active user mostly in ExtraCash. Right?
Answer – Jason Wilk: Yeah. Yeah. That's right.
Question – Joseph Vafi: So, going back to that first piece, which is monthly active growth, you still have a
very attractive customer acquisition cost metric, right?

Answer – Jason Wilk: That's right.
Question – Joseph Vafi: And I believe in the quarter, you might have even improved the payback period on
that. Is that correct?
Answer – Jason Wilk: That's right.
Question – Joseph Vafi: And so, you're printing money, do you think you should accelerate your – or should
you accelerate your CAC or your spend on customer ac here because you're doing so well, or is it, do you
think the model is kind of fine-tuned where it should be here?
Answer – Jason Wilk: Well, look, I think well, to your point, our paybacks are at an all-time low. We're now
paying back our customer acquisition cost on a gross basis in four months at this point. So, it has been
fantastic return on investment. Some of the lowest CAC to payback returns in the industry by some margin.
And we only saw $1 increase in CAC sequentially as a result of us increasing marketing spend.
We acquired almost 800,000 new members in the quarter. So, it's a fantastic growth algorithm at such a low
CAC. But we're making such rapid strides in ARPU growth and LTV expansion that we don't feel the need to
step on the gas too much, I mean we're seeing fantastic year-over-year growth rate, think it's more than
healthy at the rate that we're growing and we're developing new products. We're pushing up average
revenue per user. And so, no need to sort of rush it. We feel very good about our sort of compounding
growth rate at this point.
Question – Joseph Vafi: Right. The price increase you put in or the price change, let's call it, couple of
quarters ago, I think everyone thought, well, hopefully it works, but clearly you had done your homework
and it was a huge homerun in terms of ARPU growth the last couple of quarters.
Answer – Jason Wilk: That's right.
Question – Joseph Vafi: You're putting in a new change in your pricing for new members, right?
Answer – Jason Wilk: That's right.
Question – Joseph Vafi: You're increasing the monthly subscription fee from $1 to $3, maybe just kind of dig
in a little bit on why you feel comfortable with that new pricing model there? I mean, you did your homework
the first time, so...
Answer – Jason Wilk: Of course.
Question – Joseph Vafi: ...hopefully you're doing your homework the second time.
Answer – Jason Wilk: Sure. So, just taking a step back on the ways the company makes money. So, since the
beginning of the business in 2017, we've had a $1 per month subscription fee and we've been in testing of
that over the last six months to measure conversion retention impact if we were to actually increase the
price.

Back in 2017, all we were offering was $75 credit limits. We didn't have a checking account that point. And so,
the value we've increased over time for the customer is not really commensurate with the subscription fee
we've been charging. So, we've been in rigorous testing for six months, landed on a $3 monthly price point
for new customers and no impact to conversion or retention.
And so, that also has helped impact our faster payback is that it's effective (00:19:49) 100% gross margin
product for the business. So, we're excited to finally see that roll out. We did not increase pricing for
existing customers yet. We feel with the pricing change, the extra cash we made last year that we're more
than sufficiently monetizing this base at this point. But we do reserve the right to increase that cost over
time should we be willing to, but we thought mostly prudent to change the price for new customers.
I went over the ExtraCash revenue model with the 5% fee. And then lastly, we are making interchange from
Mastercard on our Dave debit card, of which we had nearly a $0.5 billion of card spend in the quarter. So that
business is growing nicely and there's a lot of synergy between ExtraCash and our debit card being that
it's instantly available if you want to access credit with our Dave card. So, it's an exciting opportunity. We're
still chipping away at hopefully making Dave more of a primary top-of-wallet card for consumers over time.
Question – Joseph Vafi: That's great. So, it sounds like the price increase for new customers, the cost to
onboard isn't that material. So, it should be accretive to margins going forward, right?
Answer – Jason Wilk: Yeah. It already is. And it's accretive to LTV as well. You can clearly see it. And as more
new users become a bigger part of the portfolio in the next year, our subscription revenue should be
growing at a very nice clip as we start to have more users onboarded on that every quarter.
Question – Joseph Vafi: Right. So, interchange is growing, but like the rocket fuel these days is ExtraCash
growth, right? Is that fair to say?
Answer – Jason Wilk: Yeah. It's ExtraCash growth and subscription revenue growth as well.
Question – Joseph Vafi: And sub revenue. Yes, yes. But maybe we'll switch gears and where you are in the
journey of exploiting those cash advances in ExtraCash to move that to Dave debit or debit card and drive
even higher interchange there like where are the pieces that you can work on from here to make sure that
money is going to the Dave card and not somewhere else?
Answer – Jason Wilk: Yeah. No, it's not a requirement people bank with Dave. I think that really separates us
from the likes of Chime, which requires a direct deposit to get any access to value, including consumer credit
with them. We take a very different approach in that people do not wake up in the morning excited to switch
their bank account, especially just to obtain short-term credit. Our approach is, we're going to offer you that
credit within minutes of joining by just linking your existing bank account to Dave.
And we think overall, the TAM of people willing to connect a bank account for access to services is far larger
than those willing to switch their entire banking life to get access to credit. And that really shows up in our
CAC with our CAC being $18 versus Chime at well over $100 for the same account sign-ups. So, we feel very
good about where we sit. We can spend one-tenth of the marketing dollars and still acquire the same
amount of customers per quarter. So, it's a very powerful engine that we've developed here.
Question – Joseph Vafi: But you're probably putting incentives in so that they send it – so they do get a Dave
bank account...

## Page 8 of 12

Answer – Jason Wilk: Yes.
Question – Joseph Vafi: ...when they do sign up if they use it or not, right?
Answer – Jason Wilk: That's correct. So, every customer that signs up in that CAC number we talk about that
is a person who is signing up for a full-on checking account with Dave. Now, whether they use that account or
not is not baked into the CAC. But we incentivize people to trial the Dave card by giving them a discount on
ExtraCash . If you want access to the money instantly on your Dave card, you're just paying the origination
fee of 5%. No additional cost out of the money instantly available on the Dave debit. If you want to have your
ExtraCash available on your external debit card, there is an additional 1.5% fee.
So, customers do save a few bucks by using the card and that's enough of an incentive to drive about 30% of
originations go from ExtraCash on to the Dave debit card, and it's a nice way to grow. We haven't really done
a whole lot of incentives beyond that. And so, you just tend to see a nice synergy between those two
products. We've been in testing with cashback rewards on gas or groceries, knowing that the top use case
for that product is people coming to borrow money for their short-term essentials.
So, we're seeing some nice uptick there and we're going to continue to chip away opportunities to do that.
But we don't need direct deposit to win. And so, the way we think about card adoption , it's an amazing way
to drive longer-term retention and engagement. And so, we're now also sort of hedging ourselves here by
building a new type of BNPL credit card type product that will give customers another opportunity to
access credit instantly, giving a little bit more duration.
And our goal really is to think of ourselves as top-of-wallet. And we think about you have your American
Express card that has all your spend, but your direct deposit goes into your Chase account. Who's your
primary account? I'd argue Amex card is your primary vehicle. And so, we're sort of shifting our approach. We
don't actually need the paycheck. We just want to be top-of-wallet.
And so, if you want to be a direct deposit with us, great. If you want to use ExtraCash a couple of times per
month and send it to the Dave card, awesome. Or if you want to use this new product we're developing for
next year, that's another way for us to get incremental top-of-wallet shots on goal.
Question – Joseph Vafi: Right. Do we have an idea when that's going to hit the market – I mean, you must be
testing and figuring some things out on it now?
Answer – Jason Wilk: Not testing yet. So, it will be in friends and family testing in Q4 and with the stretch
goal of testing with new customers in the fourth quarter as well.
Question – Joseph Vafi: Okay.
Answer – Jason Wilk: But that will go through a pretty rigorous review process because we'll be testing the
efficacy of our CashAI underwriting from ExtraCash on to this new product that does extend slightly longer
duration of, call it 30 days to 60 days. And so, once we get confidence in the loss rates on that, then we can
more broadly roll that out. But we're excited. Buy-now-pay-later is a very hot category with our customers.
Over half our users, which we can see in our transaction data, are engaging with BNPL in some form or
fashion and we have a zero percent market share.

Question – Joseph Vafi: And they're paying it off. You can see that too, right?
Answer – Jason Wilk: That's the beauty of our information we have access to.
Question – Joseph Vafi: Right. You see everything they're doing, right?
Answer – Jason Wilk: That's right. We know who you bank with. We know who your credit providers are. We
know if you're paying back on time. We know what fees you're likely paying. And so, it's a tremendous data
set we have to gain competitive intelligence on what we should be building just by virtue of what our
customers are interacting with.
Question – Joseph Vafi: Right. So, it sounds like you see that opportunity. Kind of clear there, it's not – you're
not doing this just because you need a new growth engine more or less. It's like a good opportunity
Answer – Jason Wilk: No. Look, we feel great just about our core business and the ability to keep growing
that at a great clip year after year for many more years to come. I mean think about our total addressable
market within ExtraCash and Dave debit being about 150 million Americans and this past quarter we only
had 2.6 million monthly paying members. So, from a total penetration perspective, we feel like we're very far
from saturation. And this new credit product will just allow us to further penetrate the TAM, have a new
go-to-market, support new distribution and just excited about the opportunity overall.
And because we don't need the growth, we're taking our time with the rollout. We want to make sure that the
loss rates are perfect, want to make sure that the product really is resonating with consumers and we've got
a really nice roadmap plan for that solution.
Question – Joseph Vafi: Got it. One more question there. If you do roll that out, it's a little longer duration. I
know you also switched your bank partner, right?
Answer – Jason Wilk: That's right.
Question – Joseph Vafi: Who may put some of their balance sheet to work on some of your loan portfolio, or
do you think your balance sheet can handle the new product as well as the existing product, or you have to
think about that a little bit?
Answer – Jason Wilk: I mean, absolutely. I mean , it's going to be another very short duration product
(00:27:46) product as well. And to your point, we announced that our new banking partner who will be the
issuing bank of this new credit product, it's called Coastal Community Bank. We're very excited to work with
them. We just signed a really unique deal with them where they're going to effectively, they're already
originating all of our ExtraCash loans right now. And now they're just going to hold those loans through to
maturity.
And so, effectively we're going to have no balance sheet at the business, zero debt on the company
whatsoever. And that's going to unlock a lot of cash for the company. We think once we migrated to that new
facility with them, that's going to bring over $100 million of net cash into the business that's currently being
tied up in receivables that the company is currently funding. So, it's a great...

Question – Joseph Vafi: Got it.
Answer – Jason Wilk: ...unlock and they're very willing to look at this new credit product as well as another
potential thing that they would fund for us.
Question – Joseph Vafi: Does that change your economics on ExtraCash if they're holding the loans on their
balance sheet?
Answer – Jason Wilk: No, it doesn't, actually. I mean, if you compare the cost of funding on this new facility
compared to what we were doing right now with our off-balance sheet facility with Victory Park, we're saving
roughly 200 basis points on that facility. So, cost will come down reducing our debt.
I'd say the one difference on this facility versus today is we are self-funding a lot of the originations. So, we
have $150 million credit facility today. Only $75 million of that is drawn. The rest we've been self-funding. In
this new model we'll likely be having Coastal fund 100% of the originations. And so, even though it's coming
at a 200 basis point reduction in cost, we are taking on – they're taking on more of the receivables. So, it's
not like a massive cost savings for the business, but it's really a way to unlock a lot more cash.
Question – Joseph Vafi: Fair enough. That makes sense. I want to circle just back to the debit card just a little
bit. Are you currently doing like virtual NFC? If they want to sign up for your debit card, they can just tap on
their phone pretty quick, or do you still have to get the physical card?
Answer – Jason Wilk: Yeah. You can provision to Apple or Google wallet within seconds of joining. It's a very
popular way for our customers to spend. The Dave checking account is a full-service checking account. You
can cash checks, you can send money, you can access a virtual card, you can...
Question – Joseph Vafi: Go to ATM somewhere.
Answer – Jason Wilk: Yeah. We have 50,000 free ATMs with our network. It's well set-up to be someone's
primary account. And we don't have an insignificant amount of people that – Dave is our primary account.
Just not the majority of our users that are using us or thinking of us in that way today .
Question – Joseph Vafi: Got it. So why – I mean, maybe it's a stupid question. So, you're kind of disrupting
big banks a little bit here not only – why aren't – do you think (00:30:37) they make more money in overdraft
still versus kind of changing their model and providing a service to you? I mean, it would be a big pivot and a
big shift from a psychological standpoint to do it?
Answer – Jason Wilk: Well, the banks and we talk a lot about this in our supplement but the big banks are
disadvantaged in the sense that their cost structure is so high that if you're looking at a customer that we're
serving today that's making under $100,000 a year, they don't have credit cards. They don't have a mortgage,
that's largely an unprofitable customer for the large banks. And so, when you factor in all the bank branch
fees or infrastructure costs, it is not a secret that it cost big banks $300 a year just to service a basic checking
account.

## Page 11 of 12

And so, the only way to recoup your costs on that is through heavy overdraft fees. And if the overdraft fees go
away, they're just going to increase their monthly minimum balance fees or charge a mandatory monthly
minimum to recoup that cost. And so, we don't think the big banks will ever be able to change their ways to
have such a low-cost structure.
Dave is entirely digital-first, no bank branches. We're using AI throughout the business from customer
support to onboarding to underwriting, and we're servicing 3 million users of 12 million total registered
customers with only 300 employees. Now that's a really impressive stat. We've had the same level of
employees now for several years at this point. And we think that we can continue to develop our roadmap
with the team we have with no meaningful investment in head count. And it's pretty amazing what you can
build and do at this point. And that's just going to further differentiate us from the big banks because those
cost savings and AI enablements end up just being pushed to the consumer in terms of better better, faster,
and cheaper product.
Question – Joseph Vafi: Sure. I don't know if it was on your earnings call or maybe one of your close
comparables where management cited the conference call comments from a big bank. And the CEO said,
look, most of our accounts are unprofitable, so.
Answer – Jason Wilk: Yeah. Like you see JPMorgan going more and more upmarket. Their goal is to open
more bank branches. They're increasing the cost of their Sapphire card. Like they want this middle, upper
class type market because there is significant LTV there. But when you think about the opportunity within the
paycheck-to-paycheck consumer, this is massive when you think about it from a digital-only AI-first approach
where you just don't have a very high cost to serve and there are fantastic returns there.
Question – Joseph Vafi: Sure.
Answer – Jason Wilk: Our margins are over 70% at this point. And we're doing that with a product that's
90% cheaper than the big banks. So that's a pretty compelling and we think long-term durable place to sit
within fintech.
Question – Joseph Vafi: That's great. You and Kyle have done an amazing job in...
Answer – Jason Wilk: Thanks.
Question – Joseph Vafi: ...growing Dave over the last few years. We got a packed room here. People clearly
paying attention to your story. So great execution here over the last couple of years and I'm looking for more.
So, awesome.
Answer – Jason Wilk: Thanks, Joe. We're excited. And then for those that maybe didn't see it this morning,
we announced a share repurchase authorization...
Question – Joseph Vafi: Oh, I didn't see it yet.
Answer – Jason Wilk: ...of up to additional $125 million. So, we're feeling very confident. We again feel that
investors really missed out on the narrative here this past quarter that Dave is well in control of loss rates and
we have an unparalleled data set with very fast payback to support that. And we're going to put our money
where our mouth is on the buybacks.
