RQ7 liquidity analysis: Cash runway 3.9-10.9 months, covenant breach probability 60-70% by Q2 2026, 95%+ by Dec 2026 → suggests interim financing or covenant waivers required before Year 4 divestiture proceeds available.",

Explicit schedule because debt paydown is discrete event (occurs at transaction close, Year 4 per RQ7 timeline revision). Allocation prioritizes interest-bearing debt (highest cost) then earnouts. Note: Total debt + earnouts = BRL 93M + BRL 271M = BRL 364M; BRL 405M paydown exceeds this, suggesting model treats all proceeds (after 25% to WC) as debt reduction; residual may go to eliminate trade payables or other liabilities.

Residual 15% DR reflects: (1) Small-cap status (3-4%), (2) LATAM emerging market exposure (2-3%), (3) SaaS sector risk (8-9% vs RFR 4.5%). 15% terminal DR is appropriate for sub-scale, profitable, low-leverage SaaS in Brazil.

RQ1: Going concern auditor warning, current ratio 0.38, cash down BRL 117M→33M, intangible impairment risk (market cap $120M vs. book ~$287M).

These factors justify X=2.0 (very high risk, speculative) vs. BASE X=1.8 (high risk). DR = 4.5% + (5.0% × 2.0) + 4.0% + 2.5% = 22.0%. End 15% assumes X multiplier drops from 2.0 to 1.2 (successful transformation post-divestiture) and size premium moderates (2% vs 4% as market cap grows). Linear fade over 5 years reflects probability-weighted convergence to bull case. If transformation fails, DR stays at 22%+ or rises (not modeled here; would be bear scenario)."
