RQ1 validates liquidity crisis with going concern warning, cash depletion, negative working capital. Combined evidence justifies DR increase from 20% to 22% (X multiplier to maximum 2.0) and divestiture timeline extension from Year 2 to Year 4. SECONDARY findings include modest downward revisions to transformation assumptions: SaaS growth 25%→24% (RQ6 P50), CPaaS divestiture multiple 0.8×→0.65× (RQ5 expected value). Net effect: Expected IVPS decline 8-15% (State 1 BRL 15.55 → State 2 BRL 13.2-14.3 range) driven primarily by higher discount rate (-8-10% PV impact) and liquidity crisis risk. ENRICH represents evidence-based calibration DOWN from BASE optimism, but NOT a fundamental repudiation of transformation thesis. Transformation remains viable (50% base case probability) but riskier and with more limited upside than originally assumed."
