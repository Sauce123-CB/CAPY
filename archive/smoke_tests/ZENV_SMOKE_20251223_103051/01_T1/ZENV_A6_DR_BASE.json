  "conclusion": "20% discount rate is the mathematical outcome of systematic risks (small-cap, LATAM EM, high-beta SaaS sector) and idiosyncratic risks (transformation execution, liquidity crisis, competitive pressure, regulatory uncertainty, governance). Not arbitrary—reflects fundamental risk-return relationship. Implies investors require 20% annual return to hold ZENV equity, vs 8-10% for S&P 500, a 10-12% risk premium. Consistent with current valuation ($67M market cap trading at 0.5× book value, 30% downside to recovery value). DR will be dynamically adjusted in outer years of projection as risk profile evolves (declines to 15% if successful, increases to 24% if distressed). Critical to get this right as DR is the linchpin connecting risk assessment to intrinsic value."
