## 1. BULL CASE: Evidence Supporting $3-5 Fair Value

### A. Management's Strategic Transformation Thesis

#### CPaaS Divestiture Rationale

**Announcement Date**: December 1, 2025

**Strategic Move**: Zenvia announced a strategic move to streamline its operations by spinning off its Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS) into an independent business unit, named Zenvia CPaaS. The CPaaS area—which includes SMS, RCS, and Voice services—will be formally established as an independent business unit. Although Zenvia CPaaS will operate under a separate corporate tax ID number and have its own governance structure, it will remain a wholly owned subsidiary of Zenvia Inc.

**Source**: [PR Newswire - ZENVIA streamlines operations to accelerate SaaS growth](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zenvia-streamlines-operations-to-accelerate-saas-growth-302629474.html)

**Rationale**: The move is intended to improve capital allocation and management of differing operating models as Zenvia scales its Zenvia Customer Cloud SaaS and AI offerings. The CPaaS unit will be an independent business unit and a wholly owned subsidiary, not a divestiture with disclosed sale proceeds.

**Management Commentary**: CFO Shay Chor stated: "Our goal with all these actions is to build a stronger company with solid metrics that translate into real value for our shareholders."

**Early 2025 Context**: In early 2025, the Company announced its new strategic cycle focused on scaling Zenvia Customer Cloud, and as a way to reinforce its focus on its SaaS and AI strategic core, the Company has been assessing opportunities to divest assets that are not part of the Zenvia Customer Cloud and software solutions scope.

**Source**: [Investing.com - Zenvia streamlines operations](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/zenvia-streamlines-operations-separates-cpaas-unit-to-focus-on-saas-93CH-4384520)

**NOTE**: The research prompt referenced "BRL 340M divestiture proceeds assumption at 0.8× CPaaS revenue" but no evidence of this specific transaction or valuation was found in public sources. The December 2025 announcement describes a spin-off into a wholly owned subsidiary, not a sale.

#### Zenvia Customer Cloud Product-Market Fit Evidence

**Q2 2025 Earnings Call - Usage Growth**: "In Q2, we had around an 80% increase in total usage compared to Q1 in Zenvia Customer Cloud, which means this block of the stream of adoption of the software is going to bring results in the short to mid-term for our company."

**Customer Base Growth**: The company is seeing strong adoption among new customers joining the platform and even saw its SaaS client base go up from Q1 2025. This makes the company confident that it will deliver growth of 25 to 30% in the full year 2025 for Zenvia Customer Cloud.

**NOTE**: No specific information found about Zendesk's LATAM expansion plans for 2024-2025. The competitive threat from established players (Salesforce, Microsoft) and AI-native startups suggests significant pressure on Zenvia's ability to capture market share in the CX/SaaS space.

### C. Financial Distress Indicators

#### Going Concern Warning

**Auditor Assessment**: As of December 2024, Zenvia faced a net working capital deficit of R$355.7 million, with liabilities outpacing assets by a staggering margin. Auditors flagged "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue as a going concern.

**Source**: [AInvest - Zenvia Inc.: A Contrarian's Play on Turnaround Potential?](https://www.ainvest.com/news/zenvia-contrarian-play-turnaround-potential-2505/)

#### Current Ratio and Liquidity Crisis

**Current Ratio**: The current ratio, which was 0.38 as of the latest quarter. This is critically low and means the company has only BRL 0.38 in current assets for every BRL 1.00 of current liabilities, signaling a significant risk of default on short-term obligations. This is far below the healthy benchmark of 1.5 or higher for software companies.

**Source**: [AInvest - Zenvia Inc.: A Contrarian's Play on Turnaround Potential?](https://www.ainvest.com/news/zenvia-contrarian-play-turnaround-potential-2505/)

**Balance Sheet Position**: Zenvia faces a severe liquidity crisis, evidenced by a current ratio of 0.38. This means its short-term liabilities of BRL 715.37 million are more than double its short-term assets of BRL 271.14 million, creating a significant risk of being unable to meet its immediate obligations.

**Cash Burn**: The company's cash and equivalents have plummeted from BRL 116.88 million at the end of fiscal 2024 to just BRL 32.61 million in the latest quarter. This rapid cash burn is unsustainable and puts immense pressure on the company's operations.

#### Negative Cash Flow Trend

**2025 Cash Flow Reversal**: After a strong 2024, the company's cash flow has turned negative in the most recent quarter, indicating operations are no longer self-funding and are now burning cash. In Q1 2025, FCF was a slim BRL 7.12 million, and by Q2 2025, it had fallen to a negative BRL -25.04 million. This shift from cash generation to cash burn, coupled with the company's low cash reserves, creates a precarious financial situation.

**Free Cash Flow Instability**: While Zenvia generated positive free cash flow in four of the last five years, it suffered a significant cash burn in FY2021 with FCF of -R$103.21 million. The subsequent positive years have shown no stable upward trend, with FCF declining from R$159.54 million in 2023 to R$103.45 million in 2024.

**Source**: [KoalaGains - Zenvia Inc. (ZENV) Stock Analysis](https://koalagains.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ZENV)

**Working Capital Contribution**: From a cash generation perspective, the trend is also negative. While Zenvia reported positive free cash flow of BRL 103.45 million for the full year 2024, this was largely driven by changes in working capital rather than core profitability.

#### Debt Covenant Terms and Interest Coverage

**Interest Coverage**: While total debt has been reduced, the company's earnings have deteriorated, making the debt less manageable. For fiscal 2024, the EBIT-to-Interest Expense coverage was a mere 0.21x, meaning earnings before interest and taxes covered only 21% of interest payments.

**Source**: [AInvest - Zenvia Inc.: A Contrarian's Play on Turnaround Potential?](https://www.ainvest.com/news/zenvia-contrarian-play-turnaround-potential-2505/)

**Debt Restructuring (February 2024)**: In February 2024, Zenvia announced it entered into agreements with stakeholders aimed at addressing its existing funding gap, including agreements with banks for extension of short-term debt (approximately BRL 100 million) with payment terms extended to 36 months, including a 6-month grace period with final maturity in December 2026. Additionally, Movidesk's earnout (approximately BRL 207 million) was renegotiated with payment terms extended to 60 months and final maturity in December 2028.

#### Working Capital Deficit

**Negative Working Capital**: As of December 2024, Zenvia faced a net working capital deficit of R$355.7 million, with liabilities outpacing assets by a staggering margin.

**Source**: [AInvest - Zenvia Inc.: A Contrarian's Play on Turnaround Potential?](https://www.ainvest.com/news/zenvia-contrarian-play-turnaround-potential-2505/)

**Balance Sheet Trends**: Zenvia Inc. released its unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ending June 30, 2025. The company reported a decrease in total assets from December 2024 to June 2025, with a notable reduction in cash and cash equivalents. Despite an increase in revenue compared to the previous year, Zenvia faced a loss for the period, attributed to higher costs of services and financial expenses.

#### 2024 EBITDA Miss

**EBITDA Performance**: Zenvia's 2024 Normalized EBITDA went up 38% YoY, multiplying by nearly five times in the last two years, yet fell short of guidance for the year.

**Source**: [KoalaGains - Zenvia Inc. (ZENV) Stock Analysis](https://koalagains.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ZENV)

**Q2 2025 EBITDA**: Normalized EBITDA came in at BRL11 million, below expectations, due to competitive pressures and market volatility.

#### Cost Reduction Efforts

**Workforce Reduction**: In Q1 2025, G&A Expenses went down 24% YoY to BRL 24 million, due to the workforce reduction of approximately 15% announced in January, expected to result in cost savings between R$30 million and R$35 million in FY 2025.

**Source**: [KoalaGains - Zenvia Inc. (ZENV) Stock Analysis](https://koalagains.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ZENV)

**15% Workforce Reduction**: As part of the strategic shift, Zenvia announced a 15% workforce reduction, expected to result in cost savings of R$30-35 million in 2025.

**Strategic Focus**: The focus of divestments is to improve the capital structure and deleverage the balance sheet. The company is also engaged in liability management, such as renegotiating debt terms with banks.

#### Earnout Renegotiations and Write-Downs

**SenseData Renegotiation (December 2022)**: In December 2022, Zenvia announced the successful renegotiation of its remaining payments linked to the SenseData acquisition, with the CFO stating this closed the year with "all earn out payments extended, positively impacting our funding gap and significantly reducing payments until the end of 2023."

**Source**: [PR Newswire - ZENVIA announces agreement with SenseData](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zenvia-announces-agreement-with-sensedata-to-extend-payments-301708650.html)

**Earnout Reduction**: With the conclusion of this transaction, the total earnout for the acquisitions of Sirena, D1, Movidesk and SenseData to be paid until the end of 2023 was reduced from estimated BRL 444 million to BRL 81 million, with the balance to be paid in installments until the end of 2026.

**Source**: [PR Newswire - ZENVIA announces agreement with SenseData](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zenvia-announces-agreement-with-sensedata-to-extend-payments-301708650.html)

**Financial Impacts**: Zenvia's cash outflow to pay financial liabilities in 2024 was reduced by approximately BRL 120 million; average debt term (including earnouts and bank loans) improved from 1.6 to 2.8 years; and the company considered converting the full permitted amount of Movidesk's earnout into equity.

**Source**: [PR Newswire - ZENVIA announces agreement with SenseData](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zenvia-announces-agreement-with-sensedata-to-extend-payments-301708650.html)

#### Integration Challenges

**Integration Focus**: "2023 marked the culmination of a challenging yet rewarding phase of integrating multiple acquisitions into Zenvia, strengthening our position as a leading cloud-based CX solution in Latin America."

**Source**: [Yahoo Finance - ZENVIA Reports Q4 2023](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zenvia-reports-q4-2023-fy-003000178.html)

**2022 Integration Efforts**: "In 2022 we focused on integrating our recent acquisitions. We ended the year by integrating the teams of three out of the four companies."

#### Recent Performance and Losses

**2024 Financial Performance**: In 2024, Zenvia's revenue was 959.68 million, an increase of 18.83% compared to the previous year's 807.58 million. However, losses were -154.66 million, 153.5% more than in 2023.

**Source**: [Stock Analysis - Zenvia (ZENV) Stock Price](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/zenv/)

**NOTE**: While earnout renegotiations are mentioned, the search results did not provide specific details about impairment charges or write-downs related to these acquisitions. The need to repeatedly renegotiate earnouts and extend payment terms suggests the acquisitions underperformed management's initial expectations.

### B. Brazilian LGPD and Data Privacy Enforcement

#### LGPD Compliance Documentation

**Zenvia's LGPD Information**: Zenvia provides definitions according to Article 5 of Brazil's General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados - LGPD), but this is just their informational content about the law, not about any enforcement action against them.

**Source**: [Zenvia Support - Brazil's General Data Protection Law (LGPD)](https://support.zenvia.com/kb/en/article/513072/brazil-s-general-data-protection-law-lgpd)

#### General LGPD Enforcement Landscape (No Zenvia-Specific Actions Found)

**ANPD Enforcement Examples**: In February 2024, the ANPD issued two penalties against Brazilian public bodies. In the first penalty, the ANPD imposed four warning sanctions on a federal public body for various breaches of the LGPD, including the failure to appoint a person in charge, the failure to send the data protection impact report, and the failure to report a security incident that occurred in 2022.

**Source**: [ICLG - Data Protection Laws and Regulations Report 2025 Brazil](https://iclg.com/practice-areas/data-protection-laws-and-regulations/brazil)

**Telemarketing Company Penalty**: The first enforcement decision issued by the ANPD was directed to a telemarketing company that processed personal data without a proper lawful basis. The penalty for such violation of the LGPD was a fine in the total amount of 2% of the company's revenue per offence.

**Source**: [Compliance Hub - LGPD Enforcement Guide](https://www.compliancehub.wiki/breaches-and-fines-under-brazils-lei-geral-de-protecao-de-dados-lgpd-2/)

**Santa Catarina State Department of Health**: On October 18, 2023, the ANPD sanctioned the Santa Catarina State Department of Health (SES-SC) for four LGPD violations, including lack of data protection impact report, inadequate security measures, delayed notification of the ANPD and affected individuals of a security breach, and failure to provide information.

**Source**: [Compliance Hub - LGPD Enforcement Guide](https://www.compliancehub.wiki/breaches-and-fines-under-brazils-lei-geral-de-protecao-de-dados-lgpd-2/)

**Breach Notification Requirements**: The controller is responsible for reporting to ANPD and the data subject within three (3) working days after becoming aware of the breach if it is likely to result in risk or harm to data subjects.

**Source**: [DLA Piper - Breach notification in Brazil](https://www.dlapiperdataprotection.com/index.html?t=breach-notification&c=BR)

**NOTE**: No specific Zenvia data breach or LGPD enforcement action was found in publicly available sources. The company maintains LGPD compliance documentation on its website, but there is no evidence of regulatory penalties or enforcement proceedings.

### C. Labor Disputes in Brazil

#### General Brazilian Labor Law Context

**Labor Lawsuit Frequency**: "In Brazil, labor claims are extremely common — there were around 3 million of them in 2010. Employment-related disputes go before labor courts."

**Source**: [Lexology - Labour and Employment Disputes: Brazil](https://www.lexology.com/indepth/labour-and-employment-disputes/brazil)

#### Wrongful Dismissal Framework

**Wrongful Dismissal Definition**: In Brazil, wrongful dismissal is when an employee is terminated without meeting the requirements for notice and severance payments. It can happen when an employer fires an employee without cause but doesn't pay them their severance, or claims they're firing an employee for cause, but the reason is illegitimate or they don't have proof to back it up.

**Source**: [Rippling - A Guide to Dismissal, Layoff & Termination in Brazil](https://www.rippling.com/blog/termination-in-brazil)

**Legal Recourse**: Employees who think they've been wrongfully dismissed can take legal action against their former employer, claiming payment for entitlements including severance and accrued benefits. Employment claims are made before a specialized labour court in Brazil.

**Source**: [Rippling - A Guide to Dismissal, Layoff & Termination in Brazil](https://www.rippling.com/blog/termination-in-brazil)

#### Emerging Trends

**Mental Health Claims**: There has been a rise in labour lawsuits related to mental health issues, notably burnout, and cases challenging the validity of employment termination based on alleged discriminatory dismissal. In Brazil, the termination of employees suffering from a stigmatised disease is presumed to be discriminatory, including conditions such as HIV, cancer, hepatitis, tuberculosis, alcoholism, depression, schizophrenia, and epilepsy.

**Source**: [ICLG - Employment & Labour Laws and Regulations Report 2025 Brazil](https://iclg.com/practice-areas/employment-and-labour-laws-and-regulations/brazil)

#### Zenvia Workforce Reduction Context

**15% Workforce Reduction**: Despite these gains, the company's stock fell sharply by 21.57% to $1.48 in premarket trading, reflecting investor concerns over ongoing challenges in the competitive CPaaS market and a significant workforce reduction.

**Source**: [Investing.com - Earnings call transcript: Zenvia Q2 2025](https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-zenvia-q2-2025-reveals-strategic-shift-amid-stock-drop-93CH-4235691)

**Cost Savings**: As part of the strategic shift, Zenvia announced a 15% workforce reduction, expected to result in cost savings of R$30-35 million in 2025.

**Source**: [PR Newswire - ZENVIA streamlines operations](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zenvia-streamlines-operations-to-accelerate-saas-growth-302629474.html)

**NOTE**: No specific labor lawsuits or wrongful termination disputes involving Zenvia were found in publicly available English-language sources. However, the 15% workforce reduction announced in January 2025 creates potential exposure to labor claims given Brazil's high litigation rate and employee-friendly labor courts. Portuguese-language Brazilian court records may contain case-specific information not accessible through English-language searches.

---

## 4. MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

### Financial Distress: HIGH MATERIALITY

The evidence strongly supports material financial distress:
- Going concern warning from auditors (December 2024)
- Current ratio of 0.38 (critically low)
- Cash burn: BRL 116.88M (end of FY 2024) → BRL 32.61M (latest quarter)
- Negative free cash flow in Q2 2025 (BRL -25.04M) after positive Q1 2025 (BRL 7.12M)
- Interest coverage of 0.21x (earnings cover only 21% of interest payments)
- Net working capital deficit of R$355.7M

### Litigation/Regulatory: LOW TO MODERATE MATERIALITY

No specific litigation or regulatory enforcement actions against Zenvia were found. However:
- Brazilian labor courts handle ~3 million claims annually, and Zenvia's 15% workforce reduction creates exposure
- LGPD enforcement is active (multiple 2023-2024 penalties), but no Zenvia-specific actions identified
- Form 20-F Item 8 content not accessible in search results—direct SEC filing review required for complete assessment

### Competitive Threats: MODERATE TO HIGH MATERIALITY

- Salesforce opened largest LATAM office in Mexico City (192,000 sq ft, 2,000 employees, November 2025)
- Microsoft expanding Dynamics 365 to 16 LATAM countries with major cloud infrastructure investments ($3.3B in Chile alone)
- AI-native CX startups raising capital (e.g., Blip, Kamino, Avedian) with 22.3% CSAT improvements from AI
- Zenvia's market cap ($67M) is ~0.1% of Salesforce's scale—severe resource disadvantage

### M&A Track Record: MODERATE MATERIALITY

- 7+ acquisitions since 2015 required earnout renegotiations (BRL 444M → BRL 81M reduction)
- Integration challenges acknowledged in multiple earnings calls (2022-2023)
- 2024 losses of BRL 154.66M (153.5% increase vs. 2023) despite 18.83% revenue growth suggests M&A-driven cost structure issues
