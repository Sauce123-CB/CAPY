Voting and Solicitation
Each Class A Common Share issued and outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date is entitled to one vote at the AGM. Each
Class B Common Share issued and outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date is entitled to ten votes at the AGM. The
ratification and approval of the financial statements and the auditor’s report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 will require
approval by an ordinary resolution (i.e., a simple majority of the votes cast, by or on behalf of, the shareholders attending and voting at the
AGM).
Internet Availability of Proxy Materials
We are furnishing proxy materials to our shareholders primarily via the Internet, instead of mailing printed copies of those materials to
each shareholder.
On or about December 5, 2025, we expect to mail to our shareholders a Notice of Internet Availability containing instructions on how to
access our proxy materials. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials directs shareholders to a website where they can access
our proxy materials, including our proxy statement and our annual report, and view instructions on how to vote via the Internet, telephone
or by proxy card. This process is designed to expedite shareholders’ receipt of proxy materials, lower the cost of the AGM, and help conserve
natural resources. If you received a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and would prefer to receive a paper copy of our proxy
materials, please follow the instructions included in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials.
Voting by Holders of Common Shares
Common Shares that are properly voted via the Internet, telephone or for which proxy cards are properly executed and returned within the
deadline set forth below, will be voted at the AGM in accordance with the directions given. The proxy holder will also vote in the discretion
of such proxy holder on any other matters that may properly come before the AGM, or at any adjournment thereof. Where any holder of
Common Shares affirmatively abstains from voting on any particular resolution, the votes attaching to such Common Shares will not be
included or counted in the determination of the number of Common Shares present and voting for the purposes of determining whether
such resolution has been passed (but they will be counted for the purposes of determining the quorum, as described above).
Voting via the Internet or by telephone helps save money by reducing postage and proxy tabulation costs. Each of these voting methods is
available 24 hours per day, seven days per week. To vote by any of these methods, read this Proxy Statement, have your Notice of Internet
Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy card in hand, and follow the instructions set forth in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy
Materials or proxy card, as the case may be.
Proxies submitted by registered shareholders and street shareholders (whether by internet or by returning the proxy card) must be
received by us no later than 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on December 17, 2025 to ensure your representation at our AGM.
The manner in which your shares may be voted depends on how your shares are held. If you own shares of record, meaning that your
shares are represented by book entries in your name so that you appear as a shareholder on the shareholder register of the Company
maintained by Computershare (i.e., you are a registered shareholder), our stock transfer agent, this proxy statement, the notice of AGM and
the proxy card will be available to you at www.investorvote.com/ZENV by inserting the control number on the Notice of Internet Availability
of Proxy Materials or proxy card to be provided to you by Computershare. You may provide voting instructions by Internet, telephone or (if
you have received paper copies of our proxy materials) by returning a proxy card. You also may attend the AGM and vote in person. If you
own Common Shares of record and you do not vote by Internet, telephone, proxy or in person at the AGM, your shares will not be voted.

Exhibit 99.2
If you own shares in street name (i.e., you are a street shareholder), meaning that your shares are held by a bank, brokerage firm, or other
nominee, you are then considered the “beneficial owner” of shares held in “street name,” and as a result, this proxy statement, the notice of
AGM and the proxy card will be available to you at www.proxyvote.comby inserting the control number on the instructions to be provided
to you by your bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee holding the shares if your bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee supports
www.proxyvote.com and has agreed to provide you with a control number for this purpose. You may provide voting instructions by the
Internet, telephone or (if you have received paper copies of proxy materials through your bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee) by
returning a voting instruction form received from that institution. If you own Common Shares in street name and attend the AGM, you must
obtain a “legal proxy” from the bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee that holds your shares in order to vote your shares at the meeting
and present your voting information card.
Revocability of Proxies
Registered shareholders may revoke their proxy or change voting instructions before shares are voted at the AGM by submitting a written
notice of revocation to our Investor Relations Department at ir@zenvia.com, or a duly executed proxy (via the Internet, telephone or by
returning a proxy card) bearing a later date (which must be received by us no later than the date set forth below) or by attending the AGM
and voting in person. A beneficial owner owning Common Shares in street name may revoke or change voting instructions by contacting the
bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee holding the shares or by obtaining a legal proxy from such institution and voting in person at the
AGM. If you are not planning to attend in person our AGM, to ensure your representation at our AGM, any changes to the voting
instructions of proxies previously submitted by registered shareholders and street shareholders (whether by internet or by mailing
a proxy card) must be received by us no later than 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on December 17, 2025.
