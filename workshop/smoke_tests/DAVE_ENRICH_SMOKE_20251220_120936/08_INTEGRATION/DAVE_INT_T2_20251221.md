## PHASE D: KERNEL EXECUTION DETERMINATION

### D.1 Cascade Scope Assessment

**Source:** DAVE_CASCADE.json (generated in T1)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| cascade_scope | NONE |
| kernel_execution_required | false |
| modifications_triggering_cascade | [] |

**Determination:** No kernel execution required. State 4 = State 3.

### D.2 Cascade Rationale

Per the T1 adjudication:

> "All HIGH findings were either REJECTED (insufficient evidentiary basis to override State 3) or MODIFIED (through interpretive guidance only, no artifact changes). No kernel input artifacts (A.5, A.6, A.10) were modified."

**Findings Summary:**
- Total findings reviewed: 8
- Findings accepted (triggering cascade): 0
- Findings rejected: 5
- Findings modified (interpretive guidance only): 2
- Low priority findings: 1

**Pipeline Fit Grade:** B (Proceed with caveats)

## PHASE E: STATE 3 TO STATE 4 BRIDGE

### E.1 Valuation Metrics (Unchanged)

| Metric | State 2 (Deterministic) | State 3 (Probabilistic) | State 4 (Finalized) |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Base IVPS | $199.25 | $199.25 | $199.25 |
| E[IVPS] | N/A | $206.34 | $206.34 |
| DR_Static | 13.25% | 13.25% | 13.25% |
| Terminal_g | 4.25% | 4.25% | 4.25% |
| Terminal_ROIC | 40.9% | 40.9% | 40.9% |

### E.2 State Bridge Summary

| Transition | From | To | Delta | Delta % |
|------------|------|-----|-------|---------|
| State 2 → State 3 | $199.25 | $206.34 | +$7.09 | +3.56% |
| State 3 → State 4 | $206.34 | $206.34 | $0.00 | 0.00% |
| **State 2 → State 4** | **$199.25** | **$206.34** | **+$7.09** | **+3.56%** |

### E.3 Distribution Metrics (Unchanged)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| E[IVPS] | $206.34 |
| Median (P50) | $188.00 |
| P10 | $146.96 |
| P90 | $239.00 |

## PHASE E.4: ARTIFACT FINALIZATION

### Kernel Execution Log

**Kernel:** CVR_KERNEL_INT_2.2.3e.py
**Execution Status:** NOT EXECUTED (cascade_scope = NONE)

Since no cascade was triggered:
1. A.7 from State 3 (ENRICH output) is copied unchanged as DAVE_A7_VALUATION_S4.json
2. A.10 from State 3 (already annotated as S4 in T1) is finalized as DAVE_A10_SCENARIO_MODEL_S4_FINAL.json

### Artifacts Produced in T2

| Artifact | Source | Action | Output File |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| A.7 Valuation Summary | 05_ENRICH/A7_kernel_output.json | COPY (unchanged) | DAVE_A7_VALUATION_S4.json |
| A.10 Scenario Model | DAVE_A10_SCENARIO_MODEL_S4.json | COPY (finalized) | DAVE_A10_SCENARIO_MODEL_S4_FINAL.json |

## PHASE E.5: INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE (From T1)

While no computational modifications were applied, the following interpretive guidance accompanies the E[IVPS]:

### 1. Regulatory Shutdown Risk (F1)

**Finding:** Complete regulatory shutdown scenario (5-10% probability, -100% impact) is not explicitly modeled despite LendUp precedent and CEO named as individual defendant.

**Guidance:** A 5-10% probability of equity-zero outcome is not captured in the 4-scenario SSE. Investors should apply a mental discount of approximately $10-20 per share when sizing positions.

### 2. Terminal ROIC Sustainability (F3/F4)

**Finding:** Terminal ROIC of 40.9% exceeds the 90th percentile of industry norms (35%) and is approximately 2x the stated long-term anchor (18-22%).

**Guidance:** If ROIC mean-reverts toward industry norms over the perpetuity period, E[IVPS] may be overstated by $20-30. Investors should apply a mental discount of 10-15% for this uncertainty.

### Combined Conservative Estimate

For conservative positioning, applying both mental discounts:
- E[IVPS]: $206.34
- Regulatory shutdown discount: -$15 (midpoint)
- ROIC sustainability discount: -$25 (midpoint)
- **Conservative E[IVPS]:** $166.34

This represents a 15-20% haircut to the model output, yielding a range of **$165-175** for risk-adjusted intrinsic value.

## SCENARIO SET (FINAL)

The 4-scenario set remains unchanged from State 3:

| ID | Scenario Name | P | M (IVPS Impact) | |P x M| |
|----|---------------|---|-----------------|--------|
| S1 | REG_SETTLEMENT | 73% | -$52.29 | $38.17 |
| S2 | BNPL_SUCCESS | 16% | +$30.59 | $4.89 |
| S3 | BANK_TRANSITION | 76% | +$42.59 | $32.37 |
| S4 | ACQUISITION | 20% | +$40.00 | $8.00 |

All scenarios RETAINED without modification. No scenario substitution performed.

## T2 OUTPUT FILES

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| DAVE_INT_T2_20251221.md | This file (kernel execution log) |
| DAVE_A7_VALUATION_S4.json | Valuation summary (copy of State 3 A.7) |
| DAVE_A10_SCENARIO_MODEL_S4_FINAL.json | Final SSE output (copy of T1's A10_S4) |

## CONCLUSION

**INTEGRATION T2 Complete.**

- Cascade Scope: NONE
- Kernel Execution: NOT REQUIRED
- State 4 = State 3
- E[IVPS]: $206.34 (unchanged)
- Delta from State 3: $0.00 (0.0%)

The CVR proceeds to T3 (Final Output) with all State 4 artifacts finalized.
