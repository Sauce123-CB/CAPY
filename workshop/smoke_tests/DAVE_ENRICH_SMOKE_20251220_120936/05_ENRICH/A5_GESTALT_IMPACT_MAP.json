Industry base rate for mature fintech: 10-15% CAGR. Posterior: CONFIRM BASE assumption - start at 15% (current run-rate) and fade linearly to 3% over 12 years as penetration ceiling approaches. Variance Justification: Starting at p90 (15% vs p50=5%) due to demonstrated execution and large conversion opportunity from 11M inactive members; fading to p10 range reflects mature market dynamics.

Fee model transition (tips \u2192 5% mandatory) sustainable per RQ1 (no churn spike post-change). Posterior: CONFIRM BASE assumption - start at 12% (fade of structural tailwinds) converging to 2% (inflation) over 10 years. Variance Justification: Above p50 near-term (12% vs 3%) due to subscription rollout ($3/mo) and monetization optimization runway; terminal 2% is conservative within p10-p50 range.

UPDATED ASSUMPTION: Through-cycle credit loss normalization from BASE 2.5% to 3.0% per RQ3b precedents (COVID-19 marketplace lenders +2.3pp default increase). Variable costs = provision + processing + network fees. Posterior: MODIFY - fade from 69% to 60% over 8 years, incorporating higher steady-state credit losses (3.0% vs BASE 2.5%). Variance Justification: Terminal 60% equals p50, reflecting structural cost advantages that persist but acknowledging higher normalized credit losses than BASE assumed.

Management claims '90% of incremental gross profit flows to EBITDA' due to fixed cost base. Peer analysis: SoFi 26-27%, Cash App 18%, MoneyLion 17%. Posterior: CONFIRM BASE assumption - fade from 41% to 35% over 6 years as scale benefits accrue. Variance Justification: Terminal 35% aligns with p50; starting point reflects continued investment phase.
