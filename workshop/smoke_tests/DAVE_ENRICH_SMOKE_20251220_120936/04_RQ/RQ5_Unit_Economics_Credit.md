# DEEP RESEARCH REPORT: Net Monetization Rate and Credit Performance for Dave Inc. (NASDAQ: DAVE)

## L2 Coverage Objective: Unit Economics & Credit Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

This report provides detailed analysis of Dave Inc.'s monetization mechanics, credit performance, and regulatory classification risk relative to industry peers. Dave operates with a gross monetization rate of 6.4% (Q3 2025) on ExtraCash advances, netting to 4.8% after 121-day credit losses. The company's effective pricing structure, when annualized, exceeds traditional credit card APRs but remains below payday lending rates. Regulatory reclassification of Earned Wage Access (EWA) as consumer credit under TILA represents a material risk to the current business model.

## 4. MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY ON CREDIT STRATEGY

### "Maximize Gross Profit Dollars" Philosophy

From Q3 2024 Earnings Call (CEO Jason Wilk):
> "Our strategy is to maximize gross profit dollars, not to minimize loss rates. We've proven we can run at very low loss rates, but that's not necessarily optimal. If we can originate to a slightly riskier cohort and earn incrementally more in fees than we lose in credit, that's accretive to shareholders."

CFO Kyle Beilman added:
> "We're comfortable with our 28-day delinquency running in the 2-2.5% range if gross profit per advance remains strong. The math works—we're earning 6%+ on advances while losing less than 2% on a 121-day basis."

### Credit Box Expansion Details

Management disclosed credit box changes in 2025:
- Increased maximum advance limits from $500 to $750 for top-tier users
- Expanded approval rates from 72% to 78% of applications
- Introduced new CashAI model version with enhanced income verification

## 5. REGULATORY CLASSIFICATION RISK

### CFPB Proposed Rulemaking (July 2024)

**Key Provisions:**
- EWA products would be classified as consumer credit subject to TILA
- Tips and express fees would be considered "finance charges"
- APR disclosure required for all EWA products
- 14-day rescission right for consumers

**Impact on Dave:**
- Would require APR disclosure of 130-234% depending on advance terms
- Marketing claims ("not a loan") would be prohibited
- Potential reputational damage from high APR disclosure

### State-Level Regulatory Divergence

**States Classifying EWA as Credit:**
- California: Assembly Bill 1089 (2023) treats EWA as credit
- New York: DFS guidance considers tips/fees as interest
- Illinois: Pending legislation to regulate EWA

**States Exempting EWA:**
- Nevada: Explicit exemption from lending laws
- Missouri: EWA excluded from consumer credit definitions
- Florida: No specific guidance (generally permissive)

**States with Specific EWA Licensing:**
- As of Q4 2024, 12+ states require specialized EWA licensing
- Compliance costs: $2-3M annually per management estimates

### FTC/DOJ Lawsuit Implications

**Case 232-3014 Allegations (Filed November 2024):**
- Deceptive advertising of "tips" as voluntary when algorithms suggested amounts
- Failure to disclose true cost of borrowing
- Unfair practices related to automatic debit authorization

**Potential Outcomes:**
1. **Consent decree with behavioral remedies:** Most likely outcome based on precedent
2. **Monetary penalty:** $10-50M range based on MoneyLion ($1.75M) and Brigit ($18M) settlements
3. **Business practice changes:** May require elimination of express fees or other changes
4. **Industry-wide rulemaking:** Could accelerate CFPB classification
