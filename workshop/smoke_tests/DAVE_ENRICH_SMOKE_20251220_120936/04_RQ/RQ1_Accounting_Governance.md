# DEEP RESEARCH REPORT: Accounting and Governance Concerns for Dave Inc. (NASDAQ: DAVE)

## Executive Summary

Dave Inc. (NASDAQ: DAVE) is a fintech neobank that completed its SPAC merger with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings III on January 5, 2022 [Dave and VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings III Announce Closing, GlobeNewswire, January 6, 2022]. The company has faced significant regulatory scrutiny, disclosed historical material weaknesses in internal controls, and experienced substantial insider selling activity during 2024-2025. This report examines key accounting, governance, and regulatory concerns for the period 2022-2025.

---

## 1. AUDITOR CONCERNS AND AUDIT OPINIONS (2022-2025)

### Independent Auditor Identity

**Moss Adams LLP** has served as Dave Inc.'s independent registered public accounting firm since January 5, 2022, when the Audit Committee engaged them to audit the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 [Dave Inc. Form 8-K, SEC, January 2022]. The firm replaced WithumSmith+Brown, PC, which was dismissed effective following completion of the 2021 audit [Dave Inc. Form 8-K, SEC, January 2022].

### Material Weaknesses in Internal Controls

Dave Inc. has disclosed **significant material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting** dating back to fiscal years 2019-2020:

- Legacy Dave identified material weaknesses that resulted in **restatements of financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019** [Dave Inc. SEC Filings, 2023].

- The company implemented remediation measures including: (i) hiring additional accounting and IT personnel; (ii) designing and implementing controls for segregation of duties; (iii) designing formal processes and accounting policies for financial close procedures; (iv) designing IT general controls including change management and user access controls; and (v) redesigning internal controls around the allowance for unrecoverable advances [Dave Inc. Q1 2023 Earnings Release, May 9, 2023].

- As of 2023, Dave continued to disclose risk factors stating "the ability of Dave to remediate material weaknesses in Dave's internal controls over financial reporting and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting" [Dave Inc. Q1 and Q2 2023 Earnings Releases].

### SOX 404(b) Exemption

As an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, **Dave Inc. is not required to provide an auditor's attestation report on its system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act** [Dave Inc. 10-K Filing, 2024]. This exemption means the company's auditor does not provide an independent opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls, creating additional risk for investors.

### Going Concern Status

The search results did not reveal any **going concern opinions** in recent filings. Dave reported strong liquidity with $91.9 million of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, investments and restricted cash as of December 31, 2024 [Dave Reports Fourth Quarter & Full Year 2024 Financial Results, GlobeNewswire, March 3, 2025]. The company achieved profitability in Q4 2023 and reported its first full year of profitability in 2024 [Dave reports first profitable quarter, American Banker, 2024].

---

## 2. REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY CHANGES

### Major Business Model Transformation (2024-2025)

Dave completed a **fundamental shift from optional "tips" to mandatory fixed fees** for its ExtraCash product:

**Previous Model:**
- Optional "tips" with a default tip setting of 15%
- Express fees ranging from $3 to $25 for instant fund transfers
- $1 monthly membership fee

**New Model (Implemented December 2024):**
- Simplified **5% mandatory fee** (with $5 minimum and $15 cap)
- No additional fees for instant transfers to Dave Checking accounts
- All new members onboarded on or after December 4, 2024 transitioned to new structure [Dave Completes Transition to Simplified Fee Structure, GlobeNewswire, February 20, 2025]

### Revenue Impact

**"Tips" revenue** was highly material to Dave's financials:
- Tips accounted for approximately **20% of 2024 estimated revenue**
- Tips represented **200% of EBITDA** [Bleecker Street Research, July 2024]
- Dave reported receiving **more than $149 million in revenue from "tips" alone from 2022 through just the first six months of 2024** [FTC Complaint, November 5, 2024]
- In Q1 2024, tips revenue grew only 8% while processing fees and advances grew 35%; tips per member fell 14% year-over-year [Bleecker Street Research, July 2024]

### Accounting Policy Concerns

The company's revenue recognition treatment of "tips" raised significant questions:
- The FTC alleged that Dave's "tips" were actually **disguised fees charged without consumer consent**, not voluntary gratuities [FTC Takes Action Against Dave Inc., FTC Press Release, November 5, 2024]
- The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposed an interpretive rule stating that "tips" and other fees should "meet the Truth in Lending Act's standard for being finance charges" [Bleecker Street Research, July 2024]
- Dave's practice of donating "just 10 cents for each percentage in 'tip' the consumer clicks on and keeps the rest" suggests the accounting classification as member-paid tips rather than company revenue may have been questionable [FTC Complaint, November 5, 2024]

### Related Party Disclosure Limitations

My research **did not identify specific related party transaction disclosures** in publicly available sources. Dave Inc. filed a DEF 14A proxy statement on April 22, 2024 [Dave Inc. Form DEF 14A, SEC, April 22, 2024], which would typically contain disclosures about related party transactions, director compensation, and potential conflicts of interest, but specific transaction details were not available in search results.

### Other Significant Insider Sales

### Insider Trading Pattern Analysis

**Critical concerns:**
- **125 insider transactions in past 6 months: 0 purchases, 125 sales** [Top Executives Cash Out Big, TipRanks]
- **111 insider transactions in previous 6-month period: 0 purchases, 111 have been sales** [Management, Dave Inc. Investor Relations]
- **Timing relative to earnings:** The massive June 2025 sales occurred during a period of extremely strong stock performance (stock surged over 4,796% from 2023 low) [Dave Inc. Earnings Announcement Dates, 2025]
- **10b5-1 Plan Usage:** Multiple executives established Rule 10b5-1 trading plans in early-to-mid 2025 (March, May, June) that facilitated large sales during the stock's peak performance period

### Red Flags

The **complete absence of insider purchases** combined with **massive, synchronized selling** by all executives and directors during 2024-2025 is a significant governance concern. The establishment of multiple 10b5-1 plans in spring 2025 followed by immediate large sales suggests potentially opportunistic timing, though 10b5-1 plans are intended to provide a defense against insider trading allegations.

## 5. SHORT INTEREST AND ACTIVIST SHORT SELLERS

### Current Short Interest Levels

**As of recent data:**
- Short interest: **1.63 million shares**
- **12.04% of outstanding shares** sold short [Dave Short Interest Ratio, MarketBeat, 2025]

### Bleecker Street Research - Major Short Report (July 25, 2024)

**Bleecker Street Research**, an activist short seller, published a comprehensive short report on Dave Inc. on July 25, 2024:

**Price Target:** "$0 to $10" with "100% downside possible" [Bleecker issues short report on Dave, TipRanks, July 25, 2024]

**Key Allegations:**

1. **Regulatory Risk:**
   - CFPB proposed interpretive rule on July 18, 2024 could "blow up Dave's business model" by treating paycheck advance products as consumer loans and requiring "tips" to meet Truth in Lending Act standards [Dave, Inc: 100% Downside Possible, Bleecker Street Research, July 2024]

2. **Predatory Lending Characterization:**
   - Report characterized Dave as "a predatory payday lender masquerading as a consumer-friendly fintech" [Dave, Inc: 100% Downside Possible, Bleecker Street Research, July 2024]

3. **Financial Analysis:**
   - Dave is "a balance sheet lender with a credit problem"
   - In 2023, Dave carried average advance assets of $114M
   - Fees earned equaled 7.1% of advances, or 227% of average advance assets (annualized) - approximately **7-8x typical interest and fee rates on subprime credit card and auto loans** [Dave, Inc: 100% Downside Possible, Bleecker Street Research, July 2024]

4. **Growth Sustainability Questions:**
   - Q4 2023 and Q1 2024 profitability came after 9% reduction in processing/servicing costs, 30% reduction in advertising & marketing, and 8% reduction in compensation costs in 2023
   - Former employees cited in report stated Dave "could only sever its entire marketing department once, as they did in 2023" [Dave, Inc: 100% Downside Possible, Bleecker Street Research, July 2024]

   - In Q1 2024, tips revenue grew only 8% while processing fees and advances grew 35%
   - Tips per member fell 14% year-over-year
   - Tipping comprised 22% of 2023 revenue [Dave, Inc: 100% Downside Possible, Bleecker Street Research, July 2024]

### Bleecker Street's Track Record

As of mid-2024, **Bleecker Research had taken the top spot among activist short sellers**, carving out a specific niche targeting small to micro-cap companies [Activist Short-Selling in H1 2024, Breakout Point].

---

## 6. SEC COMMENT LETTERS AND INQUIRIES

### SEC Comment Letters

My research **did not identify any publicly disclosed SEC comment letters** specifically addressing Dave Inc.'s financial reporting for 2023-2024. SEC comment letters are typically found in the SEC EDGAR database under correspondence filings, but none were identified in search results.

### FTC and DOJ Enforcement Actions

While not SEC-initiated, Dave faces significant federal enforcement action that has accounting and disclosure implications:

**FTC Complaint (November 5, 2024):**

The Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit alleging:

1. **Deceptive Advertising:** Dave advertised consumers could receive "up to $500" cash advances "instantly," when few consumers received the advertised amount and most weren't offered any advance [FTC Takes Action Against Dave Inc., FTC Press Release, November 5, 2024]

2. **Undisclosed Fees:** Consumers were charged undisclosed "Express Fees" ranging from $3 to $25, and the $1 monthly membership fee was not clearly disclosed [FTC Takes Action Against Dave Inc., FTC Press Release, November 5, 2024]

3. **Disguised "Tips":** Consumers were charged a surprise fee of 15% described as a "tip" without meaningful consent. The FTC alleged "Many consumers are either unaware that Dave is charging them or unaware that there is any way to avoid being charged" [FTC Takes Action Against Dave Inc., FTC Press Release, November 5, 2024]

**DOJ Amended Complaint (December 2024):**

The FTC referred the case to the U.S. Department of Justice, which filed an amended complaint:
- **CEO Jason Wilk was named as an individual defendant** [FTC Refers Case to DOJ, FTC Press Release, December 2024]
- Charges violations of the **FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act (ROSCA)**
- Seeks both **refunds for consumers and civil penalties** [Office of Public Affairs, DOJ, 2024]

**Company Response:**

Dave stated the amended complaint is "a continued example of government overreach" and includes "various inaccuracies," emphasizing that the FTC's action relates to "consumer disclosures and consent, not our ability to charge subscription fees and optional tips and express fees moving forward" [Dave Issues Statement, Dave Inc. Investor Relations, December 31, 2024].

---

## SUMMARY OF KEY CONCERNS

### Critical Red Flags:

1. **Material Weaknesses:** Historical material weaknesses in internal controls with restatements for 2019-2020; exemption from SOX 404(b) auditor attestation

2. **Revenue Model Transformation:** Fundamental business model change eliminating tips (20% of revenue, 200% of EBITDA) under regulatory pressure

3. **Regulatory Enforcement:** Active FTC/DOJ lawsuit naming CEO as individual defendant, challenging core revenue practices as deceptive

4. **Insider Selling:** Unprecedented insider selling with 125+ consecutive sales and zero purchases; executives sold $48M+ in June 2025 alone

5. **Short Seller Scrutiny:** Bleecker Street Research $0-$10 price target citing regulatory risk, predatory lending characterization, and unsustainable growth

6. **Short Interest:** 12% of shares outstanding sold short, indicating significant bearish sentiment

### Mitigating Factors:

- Strong recent financial performance (41.2M net income TTM September 30, 2024)
- Positive analyst coverage (average 12-month price target $280.88)
- Proactive business model changes to address regulatory concerns
- Strong liquidity position ($91.9M cash and equivalents)
