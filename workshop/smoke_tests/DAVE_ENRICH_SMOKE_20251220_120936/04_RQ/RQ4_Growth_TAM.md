## L1 Coverage Objective: Growth/TAM Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes Dave Inc.'s growth trajectory, Total Addressable Market (TAM), and competitive positioning relative to major fintech peers including Chime, Cash App, SoFi, and MoneyLion. Dave has demonstrated consistent MTM (Monthly Transacting Member) growth of 13-23% YoY across recent quarters, with 2.77M MTMs as of Q3 2025. However, broader market signals from Cash App (flat MAUs for 4 quarters) suggest potential saturation in the paycheck-advance space.

- Revenue: $350-360 million (vs. $270M in 2024, +30% YoY)
- Adjusted EBITDA: $90-100 million (27-28% margin)
- MTMs: 3.0-3.2 million by year-end

### Growth Drivers Cited by Management

1. **ExtraCash Limit Increases:** Expanding maximum advance from $500 to higher limits for qualified users
2. **Dave Banking Adoption:** Cross-selling checking accounts to ExtraCash users
3. **International Expansion:** Exploring Canada and UK markets (early stage)
4. **CashAI Improvements:** Continued ML model enhancements driving better risk selection

### Management Commentary on Competition

CEO Jason Wilk (Q3 2024 Earnings Call):

## 5. KEY RISKS TO GROWTH THESIS

### 1. Market Saturation (Cash App Signal)
- Cash App's flat MAU growth may foreshadow broader fintech saturation
- Dave's smaller scale means longer runway, but ceiling may be lower than TAM suggests

### 2. Regulatory Impact on TAM
- CFPB rulemaking could shrink accessible market if EWA classified as credit
- State-by-state licensing requirements create friction for expansion
- FTC lawsuit outcome could limit marketing claims and user acquisition

### 3. Economic Cycle Sensitivity
- Recession would increase demand for advances but also increase credit losses
- Credit-challenged consumers more vulnerable to economic shocks
- Delinquency already trending up (2.33% in Q3 2025 vs. 1.50% in Q1 2025)

### 4. Chime IPO Overhang
- Successful Chime IPO could attract more competition to neobank space
- Chime's lower valuation ($11.6B vs. $25B peak) may pressure Dave multiple
- Increased investor scrutiny of unit economics across fintech sector
