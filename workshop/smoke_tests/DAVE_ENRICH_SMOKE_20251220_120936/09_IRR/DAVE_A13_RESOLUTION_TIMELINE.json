Rationale: (1) CFPB/FTC enforcement creates negative narrative overhang that slows re-rating even if fundamentals validate, (2) Lack of positive recognition catalysts (no investor days, index inclusion, or coverage expansion), (3) Uncertainty in institutional ownership could be <10% active. CR = 0.15 implies 4.3-year half-life for convergence (slower than 3-4 year base rate), reflecting headwinds.

      "Regulatory Stigma Persists Despite Settlement: Even if DAVE settles CFPB/FTC enforcement for manageable amount (<5% market cap), the market may permanently discount the stock as 'regulatory problem child' similar to Robinhood post-GameStop. Multiple compression persists (8x EBITDA vs. 12x for clean peers), capital markets access constrained, board/management distraction perceived. Precedent: Robinhood and LendingClub never recovered pre-crisis multiples. Probability 30-40%. Impact: CR may be overstated; market requires 2-3 years of clean operation post-settlement before re-rating.",
      "BNPL Commoditization Limits Upside: BNPL market becoming commoditized with intense competition (Affirm, Afterpay/Block, Klarna, PayPal). DAVE's entry may generate revenue but at razor-thin margins that don't support multiple expansion. Take rates compress (merchants negotiate 3-4% vs. 6%), credit losses higher than modeled (economic downturn), CAC rises (competitive bidding). Affirm's EBITDA margins compressed from 10% to 5% (2021-2024). Probability 40-50%. Impact: Scenario S2 magnitude (+$30.59) overstated; reality could be +$10-15 (half modeled impact).",
      "Incumbent Banks Enter Earned Wage Access (EWA) Market: Major banks (Chase, BofA, Wells Fargo) could launch competing EWA products directly to existing customers, eliminating DAVE's distribution advantage. Banks have lower cost of capital (deposit funding), existing relationships (no CAC for cross-sell), bundled offerings (integrated checking), and lower regulatory risk (OCC oversight). Precedent: Chime prompted fee-free checking, Venmo led to Zelle, PayPal BNPL triggered bank BNPL. Probability 25-35% within 2 years. Impact: DAVE's terminal ROIC 40.9% unsustainable; competitive dynamics force margin compression, reducing intrinsic value 15-25%."
