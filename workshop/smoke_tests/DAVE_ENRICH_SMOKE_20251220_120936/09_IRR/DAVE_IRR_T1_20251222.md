## 3. Resolution Percentage (rho) Derivation by Scenario

### 3.1 S1_REG_SETTLEMENT (P=0.73, M=-$52.29)

**Scenario Description:** Regulatory settlement resulting in negative impact from compliance costs, potential fines, or operational restrictions.

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Primary Driver** | LEGAL_TIMELINE |
| **Key Dates Before T+1:** | |
| - Q1 2026 | Potential regulatory decision timeline (per industry patterns for fintech) |
| - Q3 2026 | Appeal/implementation window if adverse decision |
| **Reference Class** | Fintech regulatory actions (CFPB, state attorneys general) typically resolve within 12-24 months of initial inquiry |
| **Evidence for rho** | No specific dated regulatory filing mentioned in State 4 bundle. General legal risk acknowledged but timeline uncertain. |

**rho Estimate: 0.25**

**Rationale:** Regulatory proceedings in fintech often extend beyond initial estimates. Without a specific docket date, settlement hearing, or consent order timeline, the default conservatism applies. The high P (0.73) suggests market awareness of regulatory overhang, but resolution timing remains uncertain. Defaulting to rho <= 0.30 per B.12 guidance.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM - Regulatory timelines are inherently uncertain; company disclosures do not specify precise dates.

---

### 3.2 S2_BNPL_SUCCESS (P=0.16, M=+$30.59)

**Scenario Description:** Successful launch and adoption of Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) product adding incremental revenue and margin expansion.

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Primary Driver** | PRODUCT_ROADMAP |
| **Key Dates Before T+1:** | |
| - Q2 2025 | Product launch (if not already launched) |
| - Q4 2025 | First full quarter of adoption metrics |
| - Q2-Q3 2026 | Seasoning of BNPL portfolio, loss rate visibility |
| **Reference Class** | Fintech BNPL launches typically show meaningful traction within 6-12 months, but credit losses require 12-18 months to season |
| **Evidence for rho** | Low P (0.16) reflects uncertain execution. Market will have some earnings visibility by T+1. |

**rho Estimate: 0.30**

**Rationale:** By December 2026 (T+1), Dave will have reported 4 full quarters of BNPL data if launched in early 2025. User adoption, revenue contribution, and early loss rates will be observable. However, full credit loss seasoning takes 18-24 months, so complete resolution is unlikely. The 0.30 estimate reflects partial information revelation through earnings.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM - Product success metrics will be partially visible, but long-term credit performance remains uncertain.

---

### 3.3 S3_BANK_TRANSITION (P=0.76, M=+$42.59)

**Scenario Description:** Successful transition to bank charter status, providing deposit-taking ability, lower funding costs, and regulatory clarity.

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Primary Driver** | LEGAL_TIMELINE / REGULATORY |
| **Key Dates Before T+1:** | |
| - 2025-2026 | OCC/FDIC application processing (18-24 month typical timeline) |
| - Q3-Q4 2026 | Potential conditional approval |
| **Reference Class** | De novo bank charters: SoFi (2022), Varo (2020), LendingClub (2021) - median 18-30 months from application to charter |
| **Evidence for rho** | High P (0.76) suggests Dave may already be in application process or have strong regulatory relationships. |

**rho Estimate: 0.35**

**Rationale:** Bank charter applications have defined regulatory timelines. If Dave is already in the process, meaningful progress (conditional approval, examination milestones) should be visible by T+1. The higher rho (0.35 vs. default 0.30) is justified by the binary nature of charter approvals and typical 18-24 month timelines. If Dave filed in mid-2024, conditional approval could come by late 2025/early 2026.

**Supporting Evidence for rho > 0.30:** Bank charter transitions have hard regulatory milestones. Unlike product success which is gradual, charter approval is largely binary with observable application status. The reference class (SoFi, Varo) shows 18-24 month cycles.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Regulatory milestones are trackable; uncertainty is primarily around timing, not observability.

---

### 3.4 S4_ACQUISITION (P=0.20, M=+$40.00)

**Scenario Description:** Dave is acquired at a premium to current price, providing immediate value realization for shareholders.

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Primary Driver** | OTHER (M&A/Strategic) |
| **Key Dates Before T+1:** | |
| - Unknown | M&A is inherently unpredictable |
| **Reference Class** | Fintech M&A: typically no warning; average time from leak to close is 3-6 months |
| **Evidence for rho** | No specific acquisition rumors or strategic review announced. Low P (0.20) reflects speculative nature. |

**rho Estimate: 0.15**

**Rationale:** Acquisition scenarios are highly binary and timing is fundamentally unpredictable. Unlike regulatory or product scenarios with observable milestones, M&A either happens or it doesn't, with minimal leading indicators. The low rho reflects that by T+1, we're unlikely to have meaningful additional information about acquisition probability unless a transaction is announced.

**Confidence:** LOW - M&A timing is inherently speculative; no evidence of active process.

## 4. Convergence Rate (CR) Derivation via B.13 Rubric

### 4.1 Base Rate

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| CR Base Rate | 0.20 | B.13.2 - Conservative anchor |

### 4.2 Inside-View Adjustments (Recognition Factors ONLY)

**Category 1: Information Dissemination Efficiency**

| Factor | Condition | Adjustment | Evidence |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Analyst Coverage | 6 analysts (per WebSearch) | +0.00 | 4-8 analysts = neutral |
| Active Institutional Ownership | ~30% institutional (est. from market cap, fintech profile) | +0.00 | 10-40% = neutral |
| Short Interest | Not specified; small-cap fintech typically moderate | +0.01 | Estimated 5-15% range |

**Category 2: Attention Catalysts**

| Factor | Condition | Adjustment | Evidence |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Investor Day | Not scheduled (no evidence) | +0.00 | N/A |
| Conference Visibility | Fintech company, likely attends industry conferences | +0.01 | Moderate visibility |
| Index Inclusion | Not in major indices; small cap | +0.00 | N/A |
| Lock-up Expiry | No recent SPAC de-SPAC overhang (2+ years post) | +0.00 | N/A |

**Category 3: Market Microstructure**

| Factor | Condition | Adjustment | Evidence |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Liquidity | ADV appears adequate (>$5M based on $3B market cap, ~$200+ price) | +0.00 | No liquidity penalty |
| Listing Venue | NASDAQ (primary US) | +0.00 | Neutral |
| Borrow Availability | Standard availability assumed | +0.00 | N/A |

**Category 4: Narrative Receptivity**

| Factor | Condition | Adjustment | Evidence |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Thesis Simplicity | "Profitable neobank at discount to intrinsic value" | +0.01 | Relatively simple |
| Recent Price Action | +131% YTD, +13% 1M | -0.02 | Up >50% (6M est.) - recency discount |

### 4.3 CR Calculation

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Base Rate | 0.20 |
| Category 1 Adjustments | +0.01 |
| Category 2 Adjustments | +0.01 |
| Category 3 Adjustments | +0.00 |
| Category 4 Adjustments | -0.01 |
| **Total Adjustment** | **+0.01** |
| **CR Final** | **0.21** |

**CR Final: 0.21** (within [0.10, 0.40] range - no variance justification required)

### 4.4 Anti-Double-Counting Verification

The following factors were explicitly EXCLUDED from CR (per B.13.5):

| Excluded Factor | Correct Location |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Management quality | Already in GIM conservatism |
| Bank charter transition | Already in S3 scenario with rho |
| Regulatory risk | Already in S1 scenario with rho |
| Revenue growth trajectory | Already in GIM |
| ROIC sustainability | Already in DR, terminal assumptions |

## 5. Multiple Selection (per B.10 Rubric)

### 5.1 Company Profile Assessment

| Metric | Value | Implication |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Q3 2025 EBITDA Margin | ~28% (from A2: LTM EBITDA $188M / LTM Rev $492M = 38%) | Mature, profitable |
| Y0 EBIT Margin | 27.2% | Solidly profitable |
| FCF Conversion | High (low capex intensity) | Cash generative |
| Growth Rate | ~48% Y0-Y1 expected | High growth |

### 5.2 Multiple Selection

Per B.10:
- **Pre-profit (EBITDA margin <5%):** 100% EV/Revenue
- **Transitional (5-20% margin):** Blend
- **Mature (>20% margin, FCF conversion >50%):** EV/EBITDA + EV/FCF

Dave's 28%+ EBITDA margin places it in the **mature and cash-generative** category.

| Multiple | Weight | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| EV/EBITDA | 70% | Primary - reflects profitability focus |
| EV/Revenue | 30% | Secondary - still relevant for high-growth fintech |

**Selection Rationale:** Dave is a rare profitable fintech. The market prices profitable companies on EBITDA multiples, but Dave's growth rate (48%+ Y/Y) means revenue multiple remains relevant. The 70/30 blend captures both profitability (EBITDA) and growth (Revenue) dynamics.

---

## 6. Anti-Narrative Check

Three substantive reasons the market may NOT re-rate DAVE higher:

### Reason 1: Terminal ROIC Sustainability Concern

The State 4 model assumes terminal ROIC of 40.9%, which exceeds industry p90 (35%) and long-term anchors (18-22%). Sophisticated investors may haircut intrinsic value estimates due to skepticism about maintaining such high returns on capital as Dave scales. The regulatory and competitive environment for consumer lending typically compresses ROICs over time.

### Reason 2: Regulatory Overhang Persistence

The S1_REG_SETTLEMENT scenario has 73% probability with -$52 impact. The market may be right to discount Dave for regulatory risk, and this overhang may persist even if no adverse action occurs. Consumer lending to underbanked populations attracts ongoing regulatory scrutiny (CFPB, state AGs), and the market may price in perpetual regulatory uncertainty.

### Reason 3: Macro Credit Cycle Vulnerability

Dave's business model (ExtraCash advances, now BNPL) is exposed to consumer credit quality. If unemployment rises or consumer delinquencies increase in 2026, Dave's provision for credit losses could spike, compressing margins. The current profitability may reflect benign credit conditions rather than sustainable unit economics. This macro risk is not explicitly modeled as a scenario but could overwhelm other value drivers.
