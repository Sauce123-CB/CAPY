# DAVE Inc. - SCENARIO Stage Turn 1 (Analytical Synthesis)

**Company:** Dave Inc. (NYSE: DAVE)
**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-20
**Stage:** SCENARIO G3_2.2.2e - Turn 1 (Analytical Synthesis)
**State Transition:** MRC State 2 → State 3 (Deterministic → Probabilistic)

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis identifies and defines the 4 most material scenarios for Dave Inc., prioritized by expected materiality (|P × M|). The scenarios span regulatory risks, product opportunities, operational transitions, and strategic M&A possibilities. The selection balances distributional completeness (both upside and downside) while focusing on discrete, high-impact events suitable for causal intervention modeling.

**State 2 Baseline (from ENRICH):**
- IVPS: $199.25
- DR: 13.25%
- Terminal g: 4.25%
- Terminal ROIC: 40.9%
- Market Price: $225.00

**Scenario Selection Rationale:**
The four scenarios selected represent the highest expected impact on Dave's intrinsic value, covering:
1. **Regulatory downside risk** (ongoing FTC litigation with industry precedent)
2. **Product diversification upside** (BNPL launch creating new revenue stream)
3. **Operational stability baseline** (bank partner transition executed smoothly)
4. **Strategic transformation upside** (acquisition by major fintech platform)

These scenarios create a distribution that captures both tail risks (regulatory shutdown, M&A premium) and mainline catalysts (BNPL, bank transition), ensuring comprehensive coverage of Dave's outcome space.

## Scenario 1: Regulatory Settlement with Business Model Impact

### Classification
**Type:** MAINLINE
**ID:** S1_REG_SETTLEMENT
**Name:** FTC/DOJ Settlement Requiring Fee Structure Changes

### Description
Dave settles the ongoing FTC/DOJ lawsuit (filed November 2024) with terms requiring elimination of "Express Fees" and restructuring of tip mechanisms. The settlement includes financial penalties and operational restrictions similar to the MoneyLion precedent ($1.75M penalty, membership fee restructuring). The intervention models reduced ARPU from lost fee revenue and partial member churn from reduced value proposition.

### Trigger Conditions
- Settlement reached within 12-18 months (industry standard timeline)
- Penalty range: $2-5M (between MoneyLion $1.75M and Chime $4.55M precedents)
- Business model modifications required (fee transparency, tip opt-out prominence)

### Probability Estimation (Bayesian Protocol)

**Prior (Outside View):**
- Reference Class: EWA/fintech companies facing CFPB/FTC enforcement (2020-2025)
- Base Rate: 60-75% of major EWA providers faced enforcement action; of those, ~85% settled vs. escalated to shutdown
- Sample: MoneyLion, Chime, SoLo Funds, DailyPay (N=6 major actions)
- P_prior = 0.70 (70% probability of settlement for companies facing first enforcement action)

**Causal Decomposition:**
P(Settlement) = P(Litigation Filed) × P(Not Appealed|Filed) × P(Settlement|Litigation) × P(Material Impact|Settlement)

1. P(Litigation Filed) = 1.0 (already occurred November 2024)
2. P(Not Appealed|Filed) = 0.95 (Dave unlikely to fight to shutdown given precedent)
3. P(Settlement|Litigation) = 0.85 (industry precedent: MoneyLion, Chime both settled)
4. P(Material Impact|Settlement) = 0.90 (fee restructuring will materially affect ARPU)

**Posterior Calculation:**
P_posterior = 1.0 × 0.95 × 0.85 × 0.90 = **0.73** (73%)

**Calibration Check:**
Triggered (P > 70% for upside scenario - though this is downside). Sanity check: 73% aligns with industry settlement rates for first enforcement actions. Dave's proactive business model adjustments (announced December 2024) suggest management anticipates settlement, supporting this estimate.

### Intervention Definition

**Intervention Type:** PARAMETRIC (GIM overlay only)

**GIM Overlay (Modified Drivers):**

1. **ARPU_Growth_Rate**
   - Base Case: LINEAR_FADE from 9.8% (Y1) to 2.0% (terminal)
   - Scenario: LINEAR_FADE from 5.0% (Y1) to 2.0% (terminal)
   - Rationale: Loss of Express Fee revenue and reduced tip adoption lowers ARPU growth in near term; terminal growth unchanged as subscription-based revenue stabilizes

2. **MTM_Growth_Rate**
   - Base Case: LINEAR_FADE from 12.8% (Y1) to 3.0% (terminal)
   - Scenario: LINEAR_FADE from 10.5% (Y1) to 3.0% (terminal)
   - Rationale: 5-7% member churn from reduced value proposition (similar to SoFi's 0% interest rate change impact); terminal growth unchanged as product stabilizes

3. **Opex_ex_Variable_Pct**
   - Base Case: LINEAR_FADE from 36.2% (Y5) to 35.0% (terminal)
   - Scenario: LINEAR_FADE from 38.0% (Y5) to 36.0% (terminal)
   - Rationale: Increased compliance costs, enhanced disclosures, and ongoing regulatory monitoring add 1-2% to operating expense ratio

**Structural Modifications:** None

**DR Overlay:**
- Applied: No
- Justification: Settlement does not fundamentally alter Dave's systematic risk profile; regulatory overhang partially priced in current equity risk

**Lump Sum (Settlement Payment):**
- FCF_Adjustment driver using EXPLICIT_SCHEDULE
- Schedule: Y1 = -$3.5M (midpoint of $2-5M range), Y2-Y20 = $0
- Rationale: One-time cash flow impact in settlement year

### Magnitude Estimation (Preliminary, Pre-Kernel)

**Estimated IVPS Impact:** -$15 to -$25 per share (-8% to -13%)

**Impact Drivers:**
- ARPU reduction from fee restructuring: -$20-30 per user annually
- Member churn: -3% to -5% of base (150K-250K users)
- One-time settlement cost: -$3.5M (~$0.30 per share)
- Increased opex: +1-2% of revenue ongoing

**P2 Reconciliation (Expected):**
Terminal economics largely unchanged (terminal g and ROIC unaffected by near-term ARPU/churn). Settlement does not create perpetuity invalidity or Economic Governor violation.

---

## Scenario 2: BNPL Product Launch Success

### Classification
**Type:** MAINLINE
**ID:** S2_BNPL_SUCCESS
**Name:** BNPL Reaches 15-20% of Revenue Within 3-5 Years

### Description
Dave successfully launches BNPL product in 2026 and achieves penetration comparable to Block's BNPL (17% of Cash App gross profit in 2 years) or approaching SoFi's fee-based revenue (41% in 7-8 years). The scenario models incremental revenue from BNPL GMV, gross margins of 40-50% (Affirm/Klarna benchmarks), and capital requirements for loan portfolio funding.

### Trigger Conditions
- BNPL product launched by Q2 2026
- 10-15% user adoption within first 24 months (2-3M users transacting)
- 3,000-5,000 merchant partnerships secured
- Unit economics achieve positive contribution margin by Year 2

### Probability Estimation (Bayesian Protocol)

**Prior (Outside View):**
- Reference Class: Fintech companies launching adjacent BNPL products (2020-2024)
- Base Rate: 80% of major BNPL launches achieve profitability within 2-5 years (PayPal, Affirm, Klarna, Block/Afterpay successful; Apple Pay Later failed)
- Achievement of 15-20% revenue contribution: ~40% within 3-5 years (Block 17% in 2 years; SoFi 41% in 7-8 years; Venmo 16% in 10 years)
- P_prior = 0.40

**Causal Decomposition:**
P(BNPL Success) = P(Launch) × P(User Adoption|Launch) × P(Merchant Traction|Adoption) × P(Unit Economics|Traction) × P(15-20% Revenue|All Prior)

1. P(Launch) = 0.95 (Dave has announced BNPL plans; funding and partner bank in place)
2. P(User Adoption ≥10%|Launch) = 0.70 (Dave has 5M+ existing user base to cross-sell; BNPL adoption at 15% of US adults)
3. P(Merchant Traction|Adoption) = 0.60 (requires significant BD effort; lacks PayPal/Block's merchant network)
4. P(Unit Economics Positive|Traction) = 0.80 (industry precedent strong; Dave has underwriting experience)
5. P(15-20% Revenue|All Prior) = 0.50 (5-year target; comparable to Block's trajectory)

**Posterior Calculation:**
P_posterior = 0.95 × 0.70 × 0.60 × 0.80 × 0.50 = **0.16** (16%)

**Calibration Check:**
Not triggered (P < 70%). 16% aligns with base rate for new product lines reaching material revenue contribution (15-20%) within 5 years. Higher than base rate for pure organic builds due to Dave's existing user base advantage.

### Intervention Definition

**Intervention Type:** PARAMETRIC (GIM overlay with revenue diversification)

**GIM Overlay (Modified Drivers):**

1. **Revenue** (New Component: BNPL_Revenue)
   - Scenario: Add BNPL revenue stream using MULTI_STAGE_FADE
   - Stages:
     - Y1: $50M (10% of user base, $500 avg transaction, 10 transactions/year)
     - Y3: $200M (20% adoption, expanded merchant network)
     - Y5: $350M (15-18% of total revenue)
   - Rationale: Follows Block/Afterpay trajectory (17% of gross profit in 2 years)

2. **Gross_Profit_Margin**
   - Base Case: LINEAR_FADE from 68.5% to 60.0%
   - Scenario: LINEAR_FADE from 70.0% to 62.0%
   - Rationale: BNPL gross margins (40-50%) diluted by lower-margin ExtraCash, but overall mix improves due to fee-based revenue vs. credit-loss-exposed revenue

3. **Opex_ex_Variable_Pct**
   - Base Case: LINEAR_FADE from 36.2% to 35.0%
   - Scenario: LINEAR_FADE from 38.5% to 35.0%
   - Rationale: Initial BNPL investment in merchant BD, tech integration, marketing; scales to base case as product matures

4. **CapEx_Pct_Revenue**
   - Base Case: STATIC at 1.0%
   - Scenario: LINEAR_FADE from 1.5% (Y1-Y3) to 1.0% (Y5+)
   - Rationale: Tech infrastructure for BNPL product, merchant integrations

5. **Receivables_Days** (New: BNPL Portfolio)
   - Scenario: Increase from 175 to 185 days
   - Rationale: BNPL installment terms (4-6 weeks) increase working capital requirements vs. ExtraCash (next paycheck)

**Structural Modifications:** None (revenue diversification modeled via GIM; no new DAG nodes required)

**DR Overlay:**
- Applied: No
- Justification: BNPL does not fundamentally alter systematic risk; remains consumer credit business with similar risk profile to ExtraCash

### Magnitude Estimation (Preliminary, Pre-Kernel)

**Estimated IVPS Impact:** +$20 to +$35 per share (+10% to +18%)

**Impact Drivers:**
- Incremental BNPL revenue: $350M by Y5 (15-18% of total)
- Gross margin expansion: +2% from fee-based revenue mix
- Operating leverage: BNPL scales faster than opex growth
- Working capital drag: +$50-100M in receivables (partially offset by securitization)

**P2 Reconciliation (Expected):**
Terminal ROIC improves modestly (40.9% → 42-43%) due to higher-margin fee revenue. Terminal g unchanged (4.25% cap at RFR). Economic Governor satisfied (g < ROIC × RR).

---

## Scenario 3: Bank Partner Transition Completed Successfully

### Classification
**Type:** MAINLINE
**ID:** S3_BANK_TRANSITION
**Name:** Coastal Community Bank Migration Executed with Minimal Disruption

### Description
Dave completes the 24-month migration from Evolve Bank to Coastal Community Bank (announced March 2025) with minimal customer churn (<5%) and improved unit economics from better bank partner terms. The scenario models the baseline "successful execution" case, which is the implicit assumption in State 2 but separated here to enable modeling of downside variants (not included in top 4).

### Trigger Conditions
- Migration completed by Q1-Q3 2027 (within announced 24-month timeline)
- Customer churn held to 3-5% (in line with industry standard for well-executed transitions)
- No service disruptions or data breaches during migration
- Coastal Community Bank's material weakness (disclosed March 2025) remediated

### Probability Estimation (Bayesian Protocol)

**Prior (Outside View):**
- Reference Class: Planned fintech bank partner transitions (2020-2025), excluding catastrophic failures (Synapse)
- Base Rate: Well-planned transitions achieve "minimal disruption" 80-90% of the time (Wise, SoFi bank charter, Chime dual-bank model all executed smoothly)
- P_prior = 0.85

**Causal Decomposition:**
P(Success) = P(No Major Service Outage) × P(Churn <5%|No Outage) × P(Regulatory Approval|Execution) × P(Coastal Controls Fixed|Regulatory)

1. P(No Major Service Outage) = 0.90 (Dave's beta launch strategy de-risks; new customers onboard first)
2. P(Churn <5%|No Outage) = 0.95 (ExtraCash product stickiness; switching costs for primary bank account users)
3. P(Regulatory Approval|Execution) = 0.98 (partner banks pre-vetted; Coastal not under consent order)
4. P(Coastal Controls Fixed|Regulatory) = 0.90 (24-month timeline allows remediation; self-identified weakness suggests proactive culture)

**Posterior Calculation:**
P_posterior = 0.90 × 0.95 × 0.98 × 0.90 = **0.76** (76%)

**Calibration Check:**
Triggered (P > 70%). Sanity check: 76% is higher than base rate (85%) might suggest, but Dave-specific factors (beta launch, 24-month timeline, prior Evolve experience) justify upward adjustment. This is a "mainline success" scenario, not a transformative upside.

### Intervention Definition

**Intervention Type:** PARAMETRIC (minor GIM adjustments for improved economics)

**GIM Overlay (Modified Drivers):**

1. **Gross_Profit_Margin**
   - Base Case: LINEAR_FADE from 68.5% to 60.0%
   - Scenario: LINEAR_FADE from 69.5% to 61.0%
   - Rationale: Better bank partner economics (lower revenue share, improved loss reserves) add +1% to gross margin

2. **MTM_Growth_Rate**
   - Base Case: LINEAR_FADE from 12.8% to 3.0%
   - Scenario: LINEAR_FADE from 12.0% to 3.0%
   - Rationale: 3-5% customer churn during transition (Y1-Y2); recovers to base case by Y5

3. **Opex_ex_Variable_Pct**
   - Base Case: LINEAR_FADE from 36.2% to 35.0%
   - Scenario: MULTI_STAGE_FADE
     - Stage 1 (Y1-Y2): 38.0% (migration costs, dual-run systems)
     - Stage 2 (Y3-Y5): 36.0% (normalization)
     - Stage 3 (Y6+): 35.0% (base case)
   - Rationale: One-time transition costs; long-term opex neutral

**Structural Modifications:** None

**DR Overlay:**
- Applied: No
- Justification: Successful bank transition does not alter systematic risk; removes overhang from Evolve regulatory issues (already reflected in base DR)

**Lump Sum (Transition Costs):**
- FCF_Adjustment using EXPLICIT_SCHEDULE
- Schedule: Y1 = -$8M, Y2 = -$4M (midpoint of $8-12M estimated transition cost, spread over 24 months)

### Magnitude Estimation (Preliminary, Pre-Kernel)

**Estimated IVPS Impact:** +$3 to +$8 per share (+2% to +4%)

**Impact Drivers:**
- Improved gross margin from better bank economics: +1% = ~$50M NPV
- Customer churn: -3-5% in Y1-Y2 = -$10-15M NPV
- One-time transition costs: -$12M = -$1 per share
- Net positive from long-term margin improvement offsetting near-term disruption

**P2 Reconciliation (Expected):**
Minimal impact on terminal economics. Terminal ROIC improves marginally (40.9% → 41.5%) from better unit economics. Terminal g unchanged. Economic Governor satisfied.

## Scenario 4: Acquisition by Major Fintech Platform

### Classification
**Type:** MAINLINE (High-Impact) / BLUE_SKY
**ID:** S4_ACQUISITION
**Name:** Dave Acquired at 25-40% Premium to Intrinsic Value

### Description
Dave is acquired by a strategic buyer (PayPal, Block, or SoFi) seeking to add EWA capabilities to their consumer finance platform. The acquisition occurs at a 25-40% premium to Dave's intrinsic value (consistent with MoneyLion's 2.8% premium to market cap, Nuvei/Paya's 25% premium, and GreenSky's 50%+ premium to trading price). The scenario models the terminal IVPS as the acquisition price rather than perpetuity value.

### Trigger Conditions
- Acquisition announced within 2027-2028 timeframe (post-FTC litigation resolution, post-bank transition)
- Acquirer: Tier 1 buyer (PayPal, Block, SoFi) or Tier 2 buyer (Chime, large PE firm)
- Premium: 25-40% above intrinsic value (market-rate for strategic transactions)
- Regulatory approval obtained (antitrust clearance)

### Probability Estimation (Bayesian Protocol)

**Prior (Outside View):**
- Reference Class: Fintech M&A for EWA/neobank targets ($500M-$2B valuation range, 2020-2025)
- Base Rate: In 2024-2025, fintech M&A activity included ~180 deals totaling $37.6B; for companies in Dave's valuation range, acquisition probability ~10-15% annually
- P_prior = 0.12 (cumulative 3-year probability ~32% at 12% annual)

**Causal Decomposition:**
P(Acquisition) = P(Strategic Interest) × P(Litigation Resolved|Interest) × P(Dave Board Accepts|Offer) × P(Regulatory Approval|Accept)

1. P(Strategic Interest from Tier 1/2 Buyer) = 0.40 (EWA is strategic gap for PayPal, Block, SoFi; Dave has scale at 5M+ users)
2. P(Litigation Resolved Favorably|Interest) = 0.70 (acquirer unlikely to bid until FTC settled; settlement probability 73% from S1)
3. P(Dave Board Accepts|Offer at 25-40% Premium) = 0.80 (board fiduciary duty; premium attractive vs. standalone execution risk)
4. P(Regulatory Approval|Accept) = 0.90 (no major antitrust concerns; EWA not concentrated market)

**Posterior Calculation:**
P_posterior = 0.40 × 0.70 × 0.80 × 0.90 = **0.20** (20%)

**Calibration Check:**
Not triggered (P < 70%). 20% is higher than base rate (12%) due to Dave-specific strategic value (scale, proven EWA model). Aligns with M&A market activity (180 deals in H1 2025 suggests active consolidation).

### Intervention Definition

**Intervention Type:** HYBRID (Parametric terminal value adjustment + Structural valuation override)

**GIM Overlay:** None (acquisition replaces perpetuity valuation)

**Structural Modifications:**
1. Terminal Value Override:
   - Type: MODIFY_EQUATION
   - Target Node: Terminal_Value
   - New Equation: "Acquisition_Price = IVPS_Base × 1.325" (midpoint of 25-40% premium = 32.5%)
   - Rationale: Acquisition price replaces perpetuity calculation; no PV discounting required (assumed exit at year 3-5)

2. Acquirer Synergy Value (Optional, Not Modeled):
   - Acquirer realizes additional value from cross-selling to existing user base (e.g., PayPal's 400M users)
   - Dave shareholders capture portion of synergy value through premium
   - Not explicitly modeled in Dave IVPS (synergy value accrues to acquirer)

**DR Overlay:**
- Applied: No
- Justification: Acquisition scenario replaces discounting; exit value realized regardless of DR

**Lump Sum:** N/A (acquisition replaces cash flow forecasting)

### Magnitude Estimation (Preliminary, Pre-Kernel)

**Estimated IVPS Impact:** +$50 to +$80 per share (+25% to +40%)

**Impact Drivers:**
- Acquisition premium: 25-40% above intrinsic value by definition
- Assumes acquisition occurs at State 2 IVPS baseline ($199.25) or after BNPL success (higher base)
- Premium range: $199.25 × 1.25 = $249 to $199.25 × 1.40 = $279

**P2 Reconciliation (Expected):**
Not applicable (acquisition scenario does not involve perpetuity valuation; Economic Governor not relevant).

---

## Integration Constraints

### Causal Dependencies
None identified. All four scenarios are independent events:
- S1 (Regulatory Settlement) does not require S2/S3/S4
- S2 (BNPL) can occur regardless of S1/S3 (though S1 fee restrictions might affect BNPL pricing)
- S3 (Bank Transition) is independent execution risk
- S4 (Acquisition) timing may depend on S1 resolution, but not structurally dependent (modeled as independent for SSE)

### Mutual Exclusivity Groups (MECE)
**MECE_1:** Acquisition Exit vs. Perpetuity Valuation
- Scenarios: [S4_ACQUISITION, BASE_CASE]
- Root Event: Company remains independent vs. acquired
- Rationale: If Dave is acquired (S4), perpetuity valuation in BASE/S1/S2/S3 does not apply. However, for SSE purposes, we model S4 as occurring in Year 3-5, so it co-exists with S1/S2/S3 pre-acquisition dynamics.
- **Implementation:** For SSE, S4 is NOT MECE with S1/S2/S3 (acquisition price reflects base + scenario impacts). If S4 occurs, terminal IVPS = Acquisition_Price rather than perpetuity value.

**Note:** In practice, acquisition scenarios are often modeled as terminal value replacements. For this SSE, we will model S4 as additive impact (premium) rather than MECE to avoid collapsing the state space.

### Economic Incompatibilities
**Incompatibility_1:** Extreme Regulatory Downside vs. Extreme Strategic Upside
- Scenario Pair: None in Top 4 (S1 is mainline settlement, not shutdown; S4 is acquisition, not organic blue sky)
- Rationale: No BLACK_SWAN downside or BLUE_SKY transformative upside in the top 4 by |P × M| ranking

**Note:** If a BLACK_SWAN regulatory shutdown scenario (probability 2-5%, impact -$200/share) had been included, it would be incompatible with S4 (acquisition), as no acquirer would bid for a company under shutdown order. However, that scenario was excluded from top 4 by expected materiality ranking.

### Constraint Summary for SSE
```json
{
  "causal_dependencies": [],
  "mutual_exclusivity_groups": [],
  "economic_incompatibilities": []
}
```

**Rationale for Minimal Constraints:**
The four scenarios selected are largely independent and can co-occur in various combinations:
- S1 + S2: BNPL launched despite regulatory settlement (fee restrictions may affect BNPL pricing but not feasibility)
- S1 + S3: Bank transition proceeds regardless of FTC settlement
- S1 + S2 + S3: All three mainline scenarios co-occur
- S4 standalone: Acquisition captures base case + impacts from S1/S2/S3 in premium

This constraint-light structure produces a full 2^4 = 16 state enumeration with high feasibility (15-16 feasible states expected), providing rich distributional analysis.

No violations of Independence Mandate (scenarios estimated independently; SSE will handle correlations via constraints).",

This reflects the nature of the scenarios: S1/S2/S3 affect operating assumptions (ARPU, revenue mix, opex, capex) but do not fundamentally restructure Dave's business model. S4 (acquisition) is modeled as terminal value premium rather than perpetuity replacement to enable SSE additivity. Lump sums (S1 settlement payment, S3 transition costs) handled via EXPLICIT_SCHEDULE on FCF_Adjustment driver per Simplified APV methodology. DR overlays not applied to any scenario (no fundamental systematic risk changes).",
      "integration_notes": "Constraints are minimal (no causal dependencies, MECE groups, or economic incompatibilities) because the four scenarios are largely independent and can co-occur. S1 (regulatory) + S2 (BNPL) + S3 (bank transition) can all occur simultaneously (fee restrictions from S1 might affect BNPL pricing, but not feasibility). S4 (acquisition) is compatible with S1/S2/S3 pre-acquisition (acquirer pays premium that reflects those scenario outcomes). This constraint-light structure produces 2^4 = 16 total states with 15-16 feasible states expected, enabling rich distributional analysis."

    "limitations_and_caveats": "1. BNPL Impact Uncertainty: S2 assumes 15-20% revenue contribution, but precedents range widely (Block 17% in 2 years vs. SoFi 41% in 7-8 years). Actual trajectory depends on merchant acquisition success and capital availability. 2. Regulatory Settlement Terms: S1 models 'typical' settlement (MoneyLion/Chime precedents), but FTC could impose stricter terms (e.g., mandatory fee caps similar to Military Lending Act 36% APR). 3. Bank Transition Timing: S3 assumes 24-month completion per Dave's announcement, but Coastal's material weakness could delay migration or force alternative partner search. 4. Acquisition Premium Range: S4 uses 25-40% premium based on 2024-2025 M&A comps, but market conditions could shift (rising rates reducing PE dry powder, strategic buyers pausing M&A). 5. Scenario Independence Assumption: SSE assumes additive impacts, but S1 (fee restrictions) + S2 (BNPL) could have non-linear interaction if BNPL relies on tip mechanisms (not explicitly modeled). 6. COVID-19/Macro Shocks Not Modeled: Credit crisis scenario (RQ3b) excluded from top 4; if recession occurs, S2 (BNPL) and S3 (bank transition) probabilities would decline (execution risk increases in downturn)."

## Next Steps (For SCENARIO T2 Execution)

**DO NOT EXECUTE THE KERNEL IN THIS TURN.**

Turn 2 will:
1. Re-ingest ENRICH artifacts fresh (A.2, A.3, A.5, A.6, A.7)
2. Parse the Scenario Execution Arguments JSON above
3. Load CVR_KERNEL_SCEN_2_2_2e.py via Bash
4. Execute `execute_scenario_intervention()` for each scenario to calculate magnitude (M)
5. Execute `calculate_sse_jpd()` for SSE integration
6. Generate A.10_SCENARIO_MODEL_OUTPUT with full distributional analysis

**Handoff Complete.**
