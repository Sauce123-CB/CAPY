  "narrative_n0": "SOURCE INTEGRITY AUDIT - DAVE INC. ACCOUNTING REVIEW\n\nHIGHEST RISK FINDING: A material transcription error was identified between the SCENARIO T2 narrative and the A.10_SCENARIO.json kernel output. The T2 markdown reports E[IVPS] = $198.34 with a -0.5% delta from State 2, but the authoritative A.10 JSON shows E[IVPS] = $206.34 with a +3.6% delta. This $8/share (4%) discrepancy is significant enough to affect investment conclusions - the T2 narrative incorrectly characterizes the scenario-weighted valuation as value-destructive when it is actually value-accretive. The error appears to be a transcription mistake during T2 narrative synthesis, as the kernel computation itself (A.10 JSON) is internally consistent with correct SSE probability math.\n\nATP COMPLIANCE: The pipeline demonstrates COMPLIANT ATP execution. Full ATP was appropriately triggered given Dave's MODERATE complexity profile (adjusted metrics, SBC materiality, fee model transition). The accounting_translation_log documents reconciliations for all high-risk categories per A.2.5 mandate. EBIT properly includes SBC expense per normative definition B.1.1. Share count uses diluted basis with warrant overhang flagged. No ATP flags remain unaddressed.\n\nARTIFACT CONSISTENCY: Beyond the critical T2/A.10 discrepancy, artifact consistency is strong. Y0_data values flow correctly from A2 through A3 (DAG), A5 (GIM starting values), A6 (DR derivation), and A7 (kernel output). The DR revision from BASE (13.0% to 13.25%) is properly documented in A6 justification with X multiplier change traced to RQ evidence (regulatory + credit risk elevation). GIM driver definitions are consistent with DAG equations. No definitional drift detected in how metrics like EBIT, NOPAT, or ROIC are calculated across stages.\n\nCITATION VERIFICATION: 8 material claims spot-checked with 7 fully verified and 1 temporal clarification needed (current vs terminal ROIC). RQ citations accurately represent source findings. Y0 data points (revenue, margins, user metrics) are traceable to Q3 2025 filings and management guidance.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: INTEGRATION stage must use A.10 JSON E[IVPS] = $206.34, NOT the T2 narrative figure of $198.34. The T2 markdown should be corrected before finalization. This is an isolated transcription error, not a systemic data integrity failure - confidence in underlying kernel computations remains high."
