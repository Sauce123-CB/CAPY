# SC DISTRIBUTIONAL AUDIT

**audit_type:** DISTRIBUTIONAL
**distributional_coherence:**
  **shape_assessment:**
    **status:** COHERENT
    **findings:**
    > The IVPS distribution is right-skewed (E[IVPS] $206.34 > Median $188.00) with multimodal characteristics. Skewness is logically explained by the scenario structure: (1) S1 Regulatory Settlement has 73% probability but only -$52 impact, creating a high-probability mass around $147-190; (2) S3 Bank Transition has 76% probability with +$43 impact, creating secondary concentration around $230-242; (3) S4 Acquisition provides +$40 uplift with 20% probability, extending the right tail to $312. The multimodality reflects genuine bifurcation between regulatory downside states (S1-only at $147) and operational success states (S3-only at $242). Tails are plausible: P10 ($147) represents S1-only outcome (regulatory settlement without offsetting scenarios), while P90 ($239) represents S3+S4 combined upside. The $165 range (min $147 to max $312) with CV of 15.9% reflects moderate uncertainty appropriate for a fintech facing regulatory litigation and strategic optionality. No pathological distributions detected: the spread is neither artificially tight (would suggest false precision) nor excessively wide (would suggest unanchored assumptions). The 16 feasible states with 100% feasibility rate confirms constraint specification was appropriate.

  **investment_implications_assessment:**
    **status:** SOUND
    **findings:**
    > Position sizing guidance logically follows from distribution shape. Key observations: (1) 64.1% downside probability (P(IVPS < Base)) appropriately signals caution despite positive E[IVPS] vs. market price; (2) Current market price ($225) sits between P75 ($215) and P90 ($239), implying market is pricing closer to upside scenarios than E[IVPS] of $206.34; (3) Sensitivity analysis correctly identifies S1 (regulatory) as dominant risk factor (-$5.23 per 10% probability shift) vs. S3 (bank transition) as dominant upside driver (+$4.26 per 10%); (4) The 3.2% upside probability (P(IVPS > 1.25 x Base)) concentrated in S2+S3+S4 combinations is appropriately modest for a company facing FTC litigation. Risk management considerations are appropriate: monitoring FTC settlement timeline (S1 driver), BNPL launch execution (S2 trigger), and bank migration milestones (S3 tracking). The investment thesis coherently bridges from distribution metrics: despite E[IVPS] slightly above market, high regulatory probability mass in left tail warrants position sizing discipline.

  **base_case_attribution:**
    **status:** WELL_EXPLAINED
    **findings:**
    > The delta between State 2 deterministic IVPS ($199.25) and State 3 E[IVPS] ($206.34) is +$7.09 (+3.6%), which is well-explained by scenario attribution. The positive delta arises from the net balance of: (1) S1 drag: 73% x (-$52.29) = -$38.17 expected contribution; (2) S2 uplift: 16% x (+$30.59) = +$4.89 expected contribution; (3) S3 uplift: 76% x (+$42.59) = +$32.37 expected contribution; (4) S4 uplift: 20% x (+$40.00) = +$8.00 expected contribution. The CVR bridge shows that despite S1's high probability and negative impact, the combined positive contribution from S3 and S4 more than offsets S1's drag, explaining why E[IVPS] exceeds the deterministic base case. The attribution makes sense: S3 (bank transition) has higher probability (76%) than S1's impact can fully offset, and S4's acquisition premium adds meaningful option value. The asymmetry is not artificial but reflects the scenario design: S1 is a moderate downside (-26% IVPS impact), while S3 is a moderate upside (+21% impact) with similar probability, plus S4 adds uncorrelated upside. This is consistent with Dave's position as a company where the base case already assumes some challenges (hence deterministic IVPS < market price), and the probabilistic model appropriately captures the option value embedded in multiple upside scenarios.

**narrative_n4:**
> The IVPS distribution for Dave Inc. is distributionally coherent, exhibiting well-characterized right-skewness and multimodality that reflects genuine uncertainty rather than methodological artifacts. The E[IVPS] of $206.34 exceeds the deterministic base case ($199.25) by 3.6%, appropriately capturing option value from BNPL launch (S2), bank transition success (S3), and potential acquisition (S4) that outweighs the probability-weighted drag from regulatory settlement (S1). Key distributional features are logically grounded: the P10-P90 range of $147-$239 spans plausible extremes (regulatory-only downside to multi-scenario upside), the 15.9% coefficient of variation reflects moderate but meaningful uncertainty for a fintech facing litigation, and the 16 feasible states confirm appropriate constraint specification. Investment implications flow coherently from distribution shape: the 64% downside probability and market price ($225) exceeding E[IVPS] suggest the market is pricing optimistic scenarios, warranting position sizing discipline despite fundamental upside potential. The base case to E[IVPS] bridge is well-attributed to scenario contributions, with S3's high-probability upside and S4's option value more than offsetting S1's regulatory drag. No pathological patterns detected - the distribution appropriately reflects a bifurcated outcome space where regulatory resolution is the pivotal uncertainty. The analysis provides actionable decision support: monitor FTC settlement developments (S1 probability driver), track BNPL launch execution (S2 optionality), and assess bank migration milestones (S3 probability anchor).
