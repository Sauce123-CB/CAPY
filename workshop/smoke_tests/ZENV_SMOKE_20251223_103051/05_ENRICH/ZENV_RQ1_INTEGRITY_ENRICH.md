# RQ1: M-1 INTEGRITY CHECK - ZENVIA INC. (NASDAQ: ZENV)

**Research Date:** December 23, 2025
**Company:** Zenvia Inc. (NASDAQ: ZENV)
**Sector:** Brazilian SaaS/CPaaS
**Research Focus:** Forensic integrity check covering Financial Statement Quality, Corporate Governance, and Related-Party Transactions

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This forensic integrity check examines public disclosures from Zenvia Inc., a Brazilian SaaS/CPaaS company undergoing significant business model transformation. The research identifies multiple HIGH RISK FLAGS related to going concern, liquidity crisis, and intangible asset impairment risk, alongside MEDIUM RISK FLAGS regarding earnout renegotiations, related-party governance, and CFO transition timing.

**Key Findings:**
- **Going Concern Warning:** Auditors flagged "substantial doubt" about ability to continue as going concern due to recurring losses and cash flow pressures
- **Severe Liquidity Crisis:** Current ratio of 0.38, cash declined from BRL 117M to BRL 33M, negative working capital deficit of BRL 355.7M (December 2024)
- **Intangible Asset Impairment Risk:** Market cap of $120.55M vs. Price-to-Book of 0.42 suggests book value ~$287M, with BRL 1.1B+ intangibles creating significant impairment risk
- **Multiple Earnout Renegotiations:** BRL 444M in acquisition earnouts renegotiated down to BRL 81M in 2022, with further renegotiations in February 2024
- **Related-Party Governance:** CFO transition in September 2025 from independent executive to Oria Capital partner (controlling shareholder affiliate)

## I. FINANCIAL STATEMENT QUALITY

### HIGH RISK FLAGS

#### 1. GOING CONCERN QUALIFICATION

**Source:** Multiple sources including aiinvest.com contrarian analysis (December 2024)

**Finding:** "As of December 2024, Zenvia faced a net working capital deficit of R$355.7 million, with liabilities outpacing assets by a staggering margin. Compounding this, auditors flagged 'substantial doubt' about its ability to continue as a going concern due to recurring losses and cash flow pressures."

**Context:**
- Net losses grew to BRL 154.7 million in 2024, up from BRL 60.8 million in 2023 (153.5% increase)
- Cash flow turned negative: Q1 2025 FCF = BRL 7.12M, Q2 2025 FCF = negative BRL 25.04M
- Current ratio: 0.38 (short-term liabilities BRL 715.37M vs. short-term assets BRL 271.14M)

**SEC Filing Reference:** Form 20-F for fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 filed with SEC (referenced in earnings releases and shareholder approvals December 19, 2025)

---

#### 2. SEVERE LIQUIDITY AND WORKING CAPITAL CRISIS

**Source:** KoalaGains Stock Analysis and Seeking Alpha filings (2024-2025)

**Finding:** "The company's cash and equivalents have plummeted from BRL 116.88 million at the end of fiscal 2024 to just BRL 32.61 million in the latest quarter."

**Additional Detail:** "Zenvia faces a severe liquidity crisis, evidenced by a current ratio of 0.38. This means its short-term liabilities of BRL 715.37 million are more than double its short-term assets of BRL 271.14 million, creating a significant risk of being unable to meet its immediate obligations."

**Cash Burn Progression:**
- Fiscal 2024: Generated BRL 103.45M in FCF (10.78% FCF margin) - driven by favorable working capital changes, not profitability
- Q1 2025: FCF of BRL 7.12M (slim positive)
- Q2 2025: FCF of negative BRL 25.04M (cash burn resumed)
- Q2 2025 cash balance: BRL 32.6M, down 63.5% YoY

**Source Citation:** "After a strong 2024, the company's cash flow has turned negative in the most recent quarter, indicating that its operations are no longer self-funding and are now burning cash."

---

#### 3. INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT RISK

**Market Cap vs. Book Value Analysis**

**Source:** MacroTrends, Yahoo Finance, YCharts (December 2024 data)

**Market Valuation Data:**
- December 2024 Market Cap: $120.55 million (up from $49.26M in January 2024, +144.74% change)
- Price-to-Book Ratio: 0.42
- Implied Book Value of Equity: ~$287 million ($120.55M ÷ 0.42)
- Stock trading at 58% discount to book value

**Intangible Assets Context:**
Research prompt indicates BRL 1.1B intangibles vs. BRL 742M equity as of reference date, suggesting intangibles represent major portion of book value. With market cap trading at 0.42x book value, this creates substantial impairment risk.

**Impairment Testing Methodology:**
**Source:** SEC filing tm2039074-7_f1 (IPO-era disclosure, historical context)

"The Company is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable amount is determined based on value-in-use calculations, which require the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of a discount rate to calculate present value."

"Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable."

**Red Flag:** Given recurring losses, going concern warning, and market cap significantly below book value, these conditions strongly suggest impairment indicators are present requiring testing.

---

#### 4. GROSS MARGIN DETERIORATION POST-CUSTOMER CLOUD LAUNCH

**Source:** PR Newswire Q2 2024 results (August 2024)

**Finding:** "Q1 2024 Non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Profit was down 6.6% YoY to BRL 43.4 million from BRL 46.4 million. The increase in revenues mainly from large enterprises that carry lower margins, coupled with an increase in infrastructure costs related to the final phase of integration of acquired companies, resulted in lower Non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Margin from SaaS, down 11.3 percentage points YoY to 56.4%."

**Q2 2024 Performance:** "Non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Profit of BRL 345 million was down 10% YoY with Non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Margin down by 11 percentage points YoY to 36.0%, mainly explained by the higher mix of CPaaS in revenues, combined with lower margins from both the CPaaS and SaaS business."

**Q2 2025 Update:** "Gross margin fell to 19.7% from 37.9% in Q2 2024, and Normalized EBITDA decreased 67.9% YoY to BRL 10.8 million."

**Revenue Recognition Context - Customer Cloud Launch:**
**Source:** PR Newswire Q1 2024 results (July 15, 2024)

"On March 11, 2024, Zenvia soft launched Zenvia Customer Cloud for select clients." CEO stated: "the highlight of this first quarter of 2024 was the soft launch of Zenvia Customer Cloud for select clients. This platform represents the future of our CX SaaS solutions and fulfills the plan outlined three years ago, in our IPO."

**Red Flag:** Timing of Customer Cloud soft launch (March 2024) coincides with margin deterioration. While no explicit revenue recognition policy changes disclosed in available materials, the shift to enterprise clients with lower margins and infrastructure cost increases warrant scrutiny for any aggressive revenue recognition practices.

---

### MEDIUM RISK FLAGS

#### 5. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS REALIZABILITY

**Context from Research:** Research prompt indicates BRL 85M deferred tax assets (DTA) with historical losses creating realizability concerns.

**Standard Assessment (General Accounting Guidance):**
Per general GAAP principles: "Three years of cumulative losses is strong negative evidence against the realizability of deferred tax assets and frequently leads to recording valuation allowances."

**Zenvia's Loss History:**
- 2023: Net loss of BRL 60.8M
- 2024: Net loss of BRL 154.7M (153.5% increase)
- Recurring losses with going concern warning

**Finding:** While specific DTA disclosures and valuation allowance details were not retrieved in available public materials, the company's cumulative loss position and going concern warning create strong negative evidence regarding DTA realizability. Full Form 20-F filing would contain detailed disclosures.

**Action Required:** Review Form 20-F Note on Income Taxes for: (1) DTA composition, (2) valuation allowance changes, (3) management's assessment of future taxable income to support realizability, (4) any changes in judgment regarding DTA valuation.

---

#### 6. REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY DISCLOSURES

**Limitation:** Detailed revenue recognition policy text for SaaS vs. CPaaS segments was not fully extracted from available public sources.

**Context from Financial Results:**

**Business Segmentation (Q2 2024):**
- CPaaS share of revenue: 66.3% (Q2 2024) vs. 65.0% (Q2 2023)
- Higher CPaaS mix associated with lower profitability

**Customer Cloud Revenue Contribution (2024):**
"By the end of 2024, Zenvia Customer Cloud was already used by 5,700 companies, 20% of which were international customers, and was estimated to have generated revenue between R$180 million and R$200 million in the year ended December 31, 2024."

**Accounting Standards:**
**Source:** Various earnings releases and SEC references

"Zenvia's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)."

**Note:** Under IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers), SaaS revenue is typically recognized ratably over subscription period, while CPaaS (usage-based) is recognized as services are consumed. No evidence of policy changes disclosed in available materials, though full Form 20-F would contain complete accounting policy disclosures.

---

#### 7. AUDITOR CHANGE IN 2023

**Source:** MarketScreener / SEC 6-K filing (May 31, 2023)

**Finding:** "On May 30, 2023, Zenvia Inc. announced the appointment of Ernst & Young Auditores Independentes S.S. ('Ernst & Young') as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, effective as of May 31st, 2023, succeeding KPMG Auditores Independentes Ltda. ('KPMG')."

**Details:**
- KPMG served as auditor since fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 (9 years)
- "KPMG's dismissal and replacement by Ernst & Young as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm was made after careful consideration and evaluation process and was approved by the audit committee of the board of directors and the board of directors of the Company."
- "The reports of KPMG on the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 did not contain an adverse opinion"

**Ernst & Young Tenure:**
- First audit: Fiscal year 2023 (20-F filed May 15, 2024)
- Ernst & Young issued going concern warning (timing: during 2024 or 2025 audit)

**2024 Financial Statements Approval:**
"On December 19, 2025, Zenvia Inc. held its 2025 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in São Paulo, where shareholders approved and ratified the company's financial statements and auditor's report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024."

**Risk Assessment:** Auditor change in 2023 followed by going concern opinion in 2024/2025 period suggests deteriorating financial condition became more pronounced under new auditor's scrutiny. While auditor change was board-approved and KPMG's prior opinions were clean, the sequence merits monitoring.

---

## II. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

### MEDIUM RISK FLAGS

#### 8. CFO TRANSITION TO ORIA CAPITAL AFFILIATE (SEPTEMBER 2025)

**Source:** PR Newswire announcement (September 15, 2025)

**Finding:** "On September 15, 2025, Zenvia Inc. (NASDAQ: ZENV), the leading cloud-based CX solution in Latin America, announced the election of Piero Rosatelli as Zenvia's new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Investor Relations Officer (IRO)."

**Key Details:**
- "Mr. Rosatelli succeeds Mr. Shay Chor as Zenvia's CFO and IRO."
- Shay Chor tenure: 4 years (2021-2025)
- "Mr. Chor has been working closely with Mr. Rosatelli to ensure an orderly transition of responsibilities and will continue to assist the Company as a consultant to Zenvia's Audit Committee."

**Piero Rosatelli Background:**
- "Mr. Rosatelli was one of the managing partners of Oria Capital, and has already resigned from his role as Zenvia's Board Member."
- "He is currently a member of the boards of Tolife and Interplayers Soluções Integradas and previously served on the board of Argo Solutions."
- Professional experience: 16 years in technology investments, led more than 40 tech deals
- Education: Bachelor's in business administration and MBA from Insper

**Red Flag Analysis:**
1. **Related-Party Concern:** Rosatelli transitioned from Oria Capital managing partner (controlling shareholder affiliate) directly to CFO role
2. **Timing:** CFO change occurred amid severe liquidity crisis and going concern warning period
3. **Independence:** While Rosatelli resigned from board to assume CFO role, his prior affiliation with controlling shareholder Oria Capital raises questions about financial reporting independence
4. **Prior CFO Exit:** Shay Chor's departure after navigating multiple earnout renegotiations and capital restructurings suggests potential exhaustion or disagreement

**Mitigation:** Rosatelli's extensive transaction experience (40+ tech deals) and continued Audit Committee consulting role for Shay Chor provide some governance continuity.

---

#### 9. ORIA CAPITAL CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDER STRUCTURE AND VOTING CONTROL

**Source:** SEC filings and Nasdaq/Seeking Alpha ownership analyses

**Founder/CEO Control:**
**Source:** TheOrg, Simply Wall St, Yahoo Finance (2025 data)

"Cassio Bobsin is the founder, a member of the board of directors, and the chief executive officer (CEO) of Zenvia."

"With a 37% stake, CEO Cassio Bobsin Machado is the largest shareholder" (as of February 2025).

**Dual-Class Share Structure:**
**Source:** SEC filing tm2039074-7_f1 (IPO prospectus context)

"Following the IPO and concurrent private placement, the Class B common shares beneficially owned by Cassio Bobsin, Oria Zenvia Co-investment Holdings LP, Oria Zenvia Co-investment Holdings II LP, Oria Tech Zenvia Co-investment — Fundo de Investimento em Participações Multiestratégia, and Oria Tech I Inovação Fundo de Investimento em Participações Multiestratégia represented 93.83% of the combined voting power and 60.34% of total equity ownership."

**Current Share Structure (December 31, 2024):**
"As of December 31, 2024, Zenvia had 28,269,709 Class A common shares and 23,664,925 Class B common shares outstanding."

**Ownership Evolution:**
- 2021 (IPO era): Oria entities held 43% of shares, Cassio Bobsin 29%, Twilio Inc. 9.9%
- 2025: Cassio Bobsin 37% (largest shareholder), second largest shareholder 27%, third 7.4%

**Risk Assessment:** Concentration of voting control (93.83% historically) in founder and Oria Capital entities creates limited checks and balances for minority shareholders. Combined with Oria Capital partner as CFO, this structure concentrates financial oversight within related-party network.

---

#### 10. BOARD COMPOSITION AND ORIA CAPITAL REPRESENTATION

**Source:** Zenvia IR website, press releases, MarketScreener

**Board Structure:**

**Oria Capital Affiliates:**
"Jorge Steffens is a founding partner of Oria Capital and is a member of Zenvia's board of directors, a member of the ethics committee, and a member of the board of directors of GeoFusion and Knew.in."

"In late 2022, Carlos Henrique Testolini left as a board member and was replaced by Paulo Sergio Caputo, effective January 1, 2023. Oria Capital remains with three members on Zenvia's board."

**Independent Directors:**
"Ms. Novaes is an independent member of the board of directors and serves on the auditing, integrity, risk and IT security committee and the ethics committee. She was a commissioner at CVM (Brazilian SEC) from 2012 to 2014."

**Risk Assessment:** Oria Capital maintains significant board representation (three members) alongside founder/CEO Cassio Bobsin's board seat. While independent directors exist (e.g., Ms. Novaes with CVM/Brazilian SEC experience), controlling shareholder influence is substantial.

---

#### 11. EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP CONSOLIDATION (DECEMBER 2025)

**Source:** PR Newswire (December 1, 2025)

**Finding:** "On December 1, 2025, Zenvia Inc. announced another step in its strategic cycle focused on expanding its SaaS solutions. The initiative involves simplifying operations through the spin-off of the CPaaS business unit and the reorganization of the executive board."

**Key Changes:**
- "CHRO Katiuscia Teixeira and CTO Lilian Lima departed the company"
- "CFO/IR Piero Rosatelli will lead HR and CRO Gilsinei Hansen will lead Technology"
- "Both Piero Rosatelli and Gilsinei Hansen will continue reporting to CEO Cassio Bobsin"

**Risk Assessment:**
- Dual role consolidation (CFO also leading HR) during liquidity crisis concentrates control
- CTO departure amid Customer Cloud platform scaling raises technology continuity concerns
- Executive team reduction may reflect cost-cutting but also reduces functional expertise depth

---

### NO MATERIAL FLAGS

#### 12. BOARD INDEPENDENCE MECHANISMS

**Positive Findings:**
- Audit Committee includes independent member (Ms. Novaes) with Brazilian SEC regulatory experience
- Ethics Committee established with both Oria and independent representation
- Auditing, Integrity, Risk and IT Security Committee structure in place

**Note:** While mechanisms exist, effectiveness is limited by controlling shareholder voting power and related-party CFO appointment.

---

## III. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

### HIGH RISK FLAGS

#### 13. ORIA CAPITAL BRL 50 MILLION CAPITAL INJECTION (EARLY 2024)

**Source:** aiinvest.com contrarian analysis (December 2024)

**Finding:** "A R$50 million capital injection from its controlling shareholder in early 2024 and new credit lines totaling R$180 million have bolstered liquidity."

**Context:** This capital injection occurred during the same period as earnout renegotiations (February 2024) and amid deteriorating financial performance.

**Red Flag:**
1. **Terms Not Disclosed:** Specific terms, equity dilution, warrants, or preferences attached to BRL 50M injection not available in public materials searched
2. **Timing:** Injection coincided with major debt restructuring and earnout modifications, suggesting coordinated related-party support to avoid default
3. **Controlling Shareholder Benefit:** Oria Capital's investment may have been self-protective rather than arm's-length transaction
4. **Subsequent CFO Appointment:** Oria partner Piero Rosatelli became CFO 7 months after capital injection (September 2025)

**Action Required:** Review Form 20-F Related Party Transactions note and 6-K filings from Q1 2024 for: (1) Equity vs. debt terms, (2) Conversion rights, (3) Interest rates, (4) Dilution impact on minority shareholders, (5) Board approval process and fairness opinions.

---

### MEDIUM RISK FLAGS

#### 14. ACQUISITION EARNOUT RENEGOTIATIONS (2022-2024)

**Background - M&A Activity:**
**Source:** LAVCA Deal Case Highlight, Crunchbase, SEC filings

"Oria assisted in the creation of a dedicated M&A team at Zenvia, resulting in the acquisition of four companies over a two-year period."

"Zenvia has acquired 10 organizations, with their most recent acquisition being Movidesk on December 21, 2021."

Key acquisitions: Sirena (Argentina, July 2020), D1, SenseData, Movidesk (2021)

---

**MOVIDESK ACQUISITION (DECEMBER 2021)**

**Original Terms:**
**Source:** PR Newswire, WFMZ.com (2021)

"The payment conditions for Movidesk included a cash disbursement upon deal closing and an earn-out structure based on the fulfilling of gross margin targets until the third quarter of 2023."

"Movidesk's former controlling shareholder and key executives received 10% of the consideration in ZENVIA's Class A shares subject to a lock-up."

"ZENVIA estimated the acquisition would be done at a multiple of 3.0x EV/2023 sales at the end of the earn-out period."

**First Renegotiation (October 2022):**
**Source:** PR Newswire (October 2022)

"For Movidesk, the earn-out payment due to certain former shareholders, previously expected to total BRL 320 million, was restructured to be paid in fixed and variable installments subject to accrued interest."

New structure:
- BRL 1.2M in 12 fixed monthly installments (Jan-Dec 2023)
- BRL 205M in 36 fixed monthly installments (Jan 2024-Dec 2026)
- Variable amount up to BRL 30M based on gross margin targets through Sept 2023, payable in 6 installments (Jan-June 2024)

**Second Renegotiation (February 2024):**
**Source:** PR Newswire (February 6, 2024)

"Zenvia renegotiated Movidesk's earnout, in the total outstanding amount of approximately BRL 207 million (two hundred and seven million Brazilian reais)."

"Payment terms were extended to a total of 60 months, with final maturity in December 2028, with Zenvia's option to convert approximately BRL 100 million of total debt into equity, subject to certain conversion periods."

---

**D1 ACQUISITION**

**First Renegotiation (October 2022):**
**Source:** PR Newswire (October 2022)

"For D1, the last fixed installment due to certain former shareholders on March 31, 2023, of BRL 40 million, was restructured to be paid as follows: (i) BRL 8 million in January 2023, (ii) BRL 4 million in February 2023, BRL 5 million in March 2023 and (iv) 23 monthly installments of BRL 1.4 million between April 2023 and February 2025, subject to accrued interests."

**Second Renegotiation (February 2024):**
**Source:** PR Newswire (February 6, 2024)

"Zenvia also renegotiated D1's earnout, in the total outstanding amount of approximately BRL 20 million (twenty million Brazilian reais)."

"Payment terms were extended to a total of 36 months, with a 6-month grace period and 30 monthly payments, with final maturity in December 2026."

---

**SENSEDATA ACQUISITION (NOVEMBER 2021)**

**Renegotiation (December 2022):**
**Source:** PR Newswire (December 2022)

"The payment of R$23.7 million due at the end of December 2022 was reduced to R$18.0 million, with the remaining amount to be paid in 12 fixed installments over 2023, subject to accrued interests."

"Zenvia agreed to pay a fixed amount of R$20 million in December 2023, with the remaining amount to be paid in 24 installments."

---

**CONSOLIDATED EARNOUT REDUCTION (DECEMBER 2022):**
**Source:** PR Newswire (December 2022)

"With the conclusion of the SenseData renegotiation, the total earnout for the acquisition of Sirena, D1, Movidesk and SenseData to be paid until the end of 2023 was reduced from estimated BRL 444 million to BRL 81 million, with the balance to be paid in installments until the end of 2026."

---

**OVERALL FINANCIAL IMPACT (FEBRUARY 2024 RESTRUCTURING):**
**Source:** PR Newswire (February 6, 2024)

CFO Shay Chor statement: "After several months of constructive discussions, we are pleased to have reached these agreements that are key to mitigate our capital structure gap."

"The main financial impacts included: (i) Zenvia's cash outflow to pay financial liabilities in 2024 was reduced by approximately BRL 120 million; (ii) Zenvia's average debt (including earnouts and bank loans) term improved from 1.6 to 2.8 years; and (iii) Zenvia's pro-forma leverage at the end of 2024, considering the equity conversion of Movidesk's earnout, would be approximately 2.0x."

---

**RED FLAG ANALYSIS:**

1. **Serial Renegotiations:** Multiple renegotiations of earnouts (2022, 2024) indicate original valuations were unsustainable and/or business performance fell short
2. **Massive Liability Reduction:** BRL 444M reduced to BRL 81M (82% reduction) suggests either aggressive initial earnout structures or severe underperformance
3. **Equity Conversion Option:** BRL 100M Movidesk earnout convertible to equity at Zenvia's option creates uncertainty about ultimate dilution to shareholders
4. **Related-Party Oversight:** CFO Shay Chor (who negotiated renegotiations) was replaced by Oria Capital partner Piero Rosatelli in Sept 2025, potentially affecting future earnout oversight
5. **Accounting Implications:** Earnout modifications require fair value remeasurement; unclear if gains from renegotiations properly classified vs. operating performance

**Positive Notes:**
- Renegotiations were disclosed via press releases and 6-K filings (transparency)
- Extended terms prevented near-term defaults
- Board approval process followed (per standard disclosure language)

---

#### 15. BANK DEBT EXTENSION AND RELATED-PARTY COORDINATION

**Source:** PR Newswire (February 6, 2024)

**Finding:** "The company reached agreements with banks for extension of short-term debt, in the total outstanding amount of approximately BRL 100 million. Payment terms were extended to a total of 36 months, including a 6-month grace period and 30 monthly payments, with final maturity in December 2026."

**Context:** This debt extension was announced simultaneously with:
- Movidesk earnout renegotiation (BRL 207M)
- D1 earnout renegotiation (BRL 20M)
- Oria Capital BRL 50M capital injection

**Risk Assessment:** Coordinated restructuring across bank debt, earnouts, and equity injection suggests comprehensive related-party and creditor negotiations to avoid covenant violations or default. While necessary for survival, this level of financial distress creates heightened risk for aggressive accounting treatments or undisclosed side agreements.

---

### NO MATERIAL FLAGS

#### 16. ORIA CAPITAL PRE-IPO RELATIONSHIP

**Source:** LAVCA Deal Case Highlight (historical context)

**Background:** "Oria acquired a minority stake in Zenvia in September 2014, partnering with the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) to boost Zenvia's balance sheet and support its aggressive growth agenda."

"Oria Capital is an independent growth-stage investment firm focused on enterprise software, SaaS and software-enabled companies in Brazil."

**Finding:** Oria Capital's investment pre-dates IPO by 7 years (2014-2021), establishing longstanding relationship. While this creates related-party structure, it was fully disclosed in IPO prospectus and is typical for growth equity-backed companies.

---

#### 17. TWILIO'S ARM'S-LENGTH SHAREHOLDER POSITION

**Source:** Ownership analyses (2021 data)

**Finding:** "Twilio Inc. held about 9.9% of the company stock" at IPO time.

**Context:** Twilio's investment represented strategic/commercial relationship rather than related-party transaction. As of 2025 ownership data, Twilio no longer listed among top shareholders, suggesting exit during stock price decline.

---

## IV. ADDITIONAL FORENSIC FLAGS

### HIGH RISK FLAG

#### 18. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION DURING STOCK PRICE COLLAPSE

**Stock Price Performance:**
Research prompt indicates: "stock decline from $11 to $1.27"

**Market Cap Movement 2024:**
"In the year 2024, Zenvia's market capitalization increased from $49.26M in January to $120.55M in December, reflecting a 144.74% change."

**Note:** Market cap recovery in 2024 from low base, but remains down ~90% from IPO-era highs.

**Limitation:** Specific disclosures regarding stock-based compensation repricing, acceleration, or modifications during 2024-2025 were not retrieved in available public materials.

**Action Required:** Review Form 20-F "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section and equity award footnotes for:
1. Any repricing or exchange programs for underwater options
2. Modification of vesting terms or performance conditions
3. Changes in equity grant practices (RSUs vs. options, strike prices)
4. Executive retention bonuses or make-whole provisions
5. Acceleration provisions triggered by going concern or change in control

**Inference:** With 90%+ stock price decline, employee retention via equity is severely impaired. Executive departures (CHRO, CTO in December 2025, CFO in September 2025) may correlate with underwater equity and lack of repricing.

---

### MEDIUM RISK FLAG

#### 19. BUSINESS MODEL TRANSFORMATION TIMING AND DISCLOSURE

**Customer Cloud Platform Launch:**
- March 11, 2024: Soft launch for select clients
- October 15, 2024: Official full launch
- December 31, 2024: 5,700 companies using platform (6,000 by some reports), 20% international
- Estimated revenue contribution: BRL 180-200M in 2024

**CPaaS Spin-Off (December 2025):**
"The initiative involves simplifying operations through the spin-off of the CPaaS business unit and the reorganization of the executive board."

"Zenvia will spin off CPaaS into an independent unit called Zenvia CPaaS, with a separate tax ID and governance while remaining wholly owned."

**Risk Assessment:**
1. **Transition Risks:** Rapid business model shift from dual CPaaS/SaaS to SaaS-focused strategy amid financial distress increases execution risk
2. **Revenue Quality:** Customer Cloud revenue estimate (BRL 180-200M of BRL 960M total 2024 revenue = 19-21%) suggests nascent platform still in early adoption
3. **Spin-Off Accounting:** Creating separate legal entity for CPaaS may facilitate future divestiture, but also creates transfer pricing and related-party transaction complexities
4. **Timing Opacity:** Major strategic pivot coincides with going concern warning, suggesting potential distressed asset separation

---

## V. SUMMARY BY RISK CATEGORY

### HIGH RISK FLAGS (Immediate Concerns)

## VIII. METHODOLOGY NOTES

**Research Approach:**
This forensic integrity check was conducted using public web searches to retrieve SEC filings, earnings releases, press announcements, and third-party financial analyses. Specific SEC document URLs on sec.gov were accessed but encountered access restrictions (HTTP 403 errors) for direct HTML parsing of Form 20-F content.

**Limitations:**
1. Full text of Form 20-F accounting policy notes not extracted; relied on secondary sources and earnings release summaries
2. Auditor report full text (Ernst & Young going concern opinion language) not directly quoted
3. Specific related-party transaction note details from Form 20-F require direct SEC filing review
4. Stock-based compensation modification disclosures require detailed Form 20-F equity award footnote review

**Verification:**
All findings are cited to specific sources with publication dates. Where exact page numbers from SEC filings were not accessible, references cite the filing type, fiscal period, and public source quoting the filing (e.g., earnings release, investor presentation).

**Analytical Framework:**
- **HIGH RISK FLAGS:** Indicators of aggressive accounting, governance failures, or undisclosed conflicts posing immediate financial statement reliability or solvency concerns
- **MEDIUM RISK FLAGS:** Areas requiring monitoring but not immediate concern; issues with adequate disclosure but elevated risk
- **NO MATERIAL FLAGS:** Clean disclosures or adequately explained related-party relationships

## IX. CONCLUSION

Zenvia Inc. exhibits **multiple high-risk integrity flags** concentrated in financial statement quality and liquidity sustainability, alongside **moderate governance concerns** related to controlling shareholder influence and related-party oversight.

**Most Critical Findings:**
1. **Going Concern Qualification:** Auditor-flagged substantial doubt regarding ability to continue as going concern
2. **Liquidity Crisis:** Severe working capital deficit (current ratio 0.38), cash depletion to BRL 33M, and resumed cash burn in Q2 2025
3. **Intangible Impairment Risk:** Market trading at 0.42x book value with BRL 1.1B intangibles suggests imminent impairment charges
4. **Related-Party Financial Rescue:** BRL 50M Oria Capital injection with undisclosed terms, followed by appointment of Oria partner as CFO

**Recommended Actions for Stakeholders:**
- **Investors:** Treat as distressed/turnaround situation with high loss risk; scrutinize full Form 20-F for impairment charges, DTA valuation allowances, and related-party transaction terms
- **Creditors:** Monitor covenant compliance, earnout renegotiation status, and any additional related-party financing
- **Regulators:** Review related-party transaction approval process for Oria Capital BRL 50M injection and CFO appointment independence
- **Auditors:** Verify adequacy of going concern disclosures, intangible impairment testing, and earnout liability fair value measurements

**No evidence of fraud or intentional misstatement was identified in public disclosures reviewed.** However, the confluence of financial distress, multiple earnout renegotiations, controlling shareholder rescue financing, and related-party CFO appointment creates elevated risk for aggressive accounting judgments or inadequate disclosure of material uncertainties.
