Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(In thousands of Reais)
1. Operations
Zenvia Inc. (“Zenvia”) was incorporated in November 2020, as a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability duly registered with the
Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands. These consolidated financial statements comprise Zenvia and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the
“Company”). The Company is involved in implementation of a multi-channel communication of a cloud-based platform that enables organizations to
integrate several communication capabilities (including short message service, or SMS, WhatsApp, Voice, WebChat and Facebook Messenger) into
their software applications and with a combination of Software as a Service (SaaS) portfolio providing clients with unified end-to-end customer
experience SaaS platform to digitally interact with their end-consumers in a personalized way.
As of June 30, 2025, the Company has a negative consolidated working capital in the amount of R$444,234 (current assets of R$271,140 and current
liabilities of R$715,374) mainly as a result of past acquisitions, leading to concerns about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management has taken many initiatives to increase profitability since 2022, such as reduction of the Company’s workforce by 25%. While these actions
were instrumental for the Company to deliver improved cash generation in FY 2024 and beginning of 2025, management is committed to continue
pursuing new operational efficiencies for the next 12 months. In February 2024, Management concluded several renegotiations with its creditors,
including banks, debenture holders and holders of other liabilities related to past M&A activity. These renegotiations include an extension of payment
terms on bank loans and debentures from 18 months to 36 months (final maturity December 2026), extension of liabilities related to past M&As from
36 months to up to 60 months (final maturity December 2028) and the possibility of converting certain M&A liabilities into Zenvia´s equity (potential
conversion estimated at circa 30% of total M&A liabilities). Additionally, in February 2024, the controlling shareholder injected a total of R$50,000 as
new equity in the Company. Since April 2024, the Company received five new credit lines from local banks in Brazil in the total amount of circa
R$80,000 and was granted additional grace periods on amortization of existing credit lines, attesting the improved perception over the Company's
credit profile. Additionally, the Company acquired R$180,000 in working capital credit lines from carriers in Brazil. Considering the Company’s short-
term financial contractual obligations and commitments after giving effect to the above-mentioned renegotiations and capital injection, management
expects a cash outlay of R$114,786 for the next 12 months mainly for its existing short-term indebtedness as it becomes due, including interest, and
payments due from acquisitions. Despite the above-mentioned initiatives and given the expected future operating cash flow, management will continue
to seek to optimize the Company's working capital needs by renegotiating payment terms with suppliers and anticipating future revenues with clients.
As announced on January 13, 2025, the Company has initiated a new strategic cycle that will focus on its SaaS business, namely on the recently
launched Zenvia Customer Cloud. As a result, management has been proactively evaluating opportunities to divest assets that fall outside the scope of
Zenvia Customer Cloud, including the CPaaS business. Management believes that the combination of proceeds from divestments, improved working
capital and renegotiations of its existing debt is key to ensure that the positive projected cash flows from operations will be sufficient for the Company’s
financial requirements for the next twelve months, and therefore that the Company will be able to continue operating as a going concern. Although
there is still uncertainty about how long it will take for these actions to be fully executed, as of June 30, 2025, these financial statements do not include
any adjustments that may result from the inability to continue operating.

| credit profile. Additionally, the Company acquired R$180,000 in working capital credit lines from carriers in Brazil. Considering the Company’s short- |
| term financial contractual obligations and commitments after giving effect to the above-mentioned renegotiations and capital injection, management |
| expects a cash outlay of R$114,786 for the next 12 months mainly for its existing short-term indebtedness as it becomes due, including interest, and |
| payments due from acquisitions. Despite the above-mentioned initiatives and given the expected future operating cash flow, management will continue |
| to seek to optimize the Company's working capital needs by renegotiating payment terms with suppliers and anticipating future revenues with clients. |
| As announced on January 13, 2025, the Company has initiated a new strategic cycle that will focus on its SaaS business, namely on the recently |
| launched Zenvia Customer Cloud. As a result, management has been proactively evaluating opportunities to divest assets that fall outside the scope of |
| Zenvia Customer Cloud, including the CPaaS business. Management believes that the combination of proceeds from divestments, improved working |
| capital and renegotiations of its existing debt is key to ensure that the positive projected cash flows from operations will be sufficient for the Company’s |
| financial requirements for the next twelve months, and therefore that the Company will be able to continue operating as a going concern. Although |
| there is still uncertainty about how long it will take for these actions to be fully executed, as of June 30, 2025, these financial statements do not include |
| any adjustments that may result from the inability to continue operating. |

The issuance of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements was approved by the Executive Board of Directors on September 10, 2025.
a. Measurement basis
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared based on historical cost, except for certain financial instruments measured at
fair value, as described in the following accounting practices. See item (d) below for information on the measurement of financial information of
subsidiaries located in hyperinflationary economies.
b. Functional and presentation currency
These interim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in Brazilian Real (R$), which is the Company’s functional currency. All
amounts have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise indicated.
The functional currency of the subsidiary Zenvia US Corporation is the US Dollar. The indirect subsidiaries of the Company have the following
functional currencies: Rodati Motors Central de Informações de Veículos Automotores Ltda. has the local currency, Brazilian Real (BRL), as its
functional currency; Zenvia Argentina S.A. has the local currency, Argentine Peso (ARG), as its functional currency; and Zenvia México has the local
currency, Mexican Pesos (MEX), as its functional currency.
c. Foreign currency translation
For the consolidated Company subsidiaries in which the functional currency is different from the Brazilian Real, the interim condensed consolidated
financial statements are translated to Real as of the closing date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into
the functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign
currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured
based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency differences are
generally recognized in profit or loss and presented within finance costs.

d. Accounting and reporting in highly hyperinflationary economy
In June 2025, Argentina continued to be classified as a hyperinflationary economy under IAS 29, as the cumulative inflation over the past three years
remained above the indicative threshold. Accordingly, the adoption of the accounting and reporting standard in hyperinflationary economies remained
mandatory for the subsidiary Zenvia Argentina S.A., located in Argentina.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities, the equity and the statement of profit or loss of subsidiaries that operate in hyperinflationary economies are
adjusted by the change in the general purchasing power of the currency, applying a general price index.
The financial statements of an entity whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy based on current cost approach are in
terms of the current measurement unit at the balance sheet date and translated into Real at the closing exchange rate for the period. The impacts of
changes in general purchasing power were reported as finance costs in the statements of profit or loss of the Company.
IAS 29 generated an impact for the six months ended June 30, 2025, in the finance result in the amount of R$1,461 (R$2,335 for the six months ended
June 30, 2024)
e. Critical use of estimates and accounting judgments
In preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements and estimates that affect the application of
the Company’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively.
Judgments:
Information about judgments referring to the adoption of accounting policies which impact significantly the amounts recognized in the financial
statements are included in the following notes:
Note 12 - Intangible assets: determination of useful lives of intangible assets.

Uncertainties on assumptions and estimates:
Information on uncertainties as to assumptions and estimates that pose a high risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next fiscal year are
included in the following notes:
Note 7 – Allowance for expected losses: main assumptions in the determination of loss rate.
Note 11 - Impairment test of intangible assets, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill: assumptions regarding projections of
generation of future cash flows.
Note 18 - Provision for labor, tax and civil risks: main assumptions regarding the likelihood and magnitude of the cash outflows.
Note 19 – Long-Term Incentive Programs and Management remuneration: the provision is determined at the contract signing date, based on the share
value and exchange rate at that moment, with no subsequent adjustments.
Note 24 – recognition of deferred tax assets: availability of future taxable profit against which deductible temporary differences and tax losses carried
forward can be utilized.
(i) Measurement of fair value
A series of Company’s accounting policies and disclosures requires the measurement of fair value, for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
Evaluation process includes the regular review of significant non-observable data and valuation adjustments. If third-party information, such as
brokerage firms’ quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair value, then the evaluation process analyzes the evidence obtained from the third
parties to support the conclusion that such valuations meet the IFRS requirements, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which such
valuations should be classified.
When measuring the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company uses observable data as much as possible. Fair values are classified at different
levels according to hierarchy based on information (inputs) used in valuation techniques, as follows:
11


### Table 1 (Page 14)

— Level 1: Prices quoted (not adjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
— Level 2: Inputs, except for quoted prices, included in Level 1 which are observable for assets or liabilities, directly (prices) or indirectly (derived
from prices).
— Level 3: Inputs, for assets or liabilities, which are not based on observable market data (non-observable inputs).
The Company recognizes transfers between fair value hierarchy levels at the end of the financial statements’ period in which changes occurred.
4. New standards, amendments, and interpretations of standards
4.1.New currently effective requirement
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the
preparation of the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, except for the adoption of new standards
effective as of January 1st, 2025. The Company has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet
effective.
The following amended standards and interpretations did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements:
●Amendments to IAS 21: Lack of exchangeability;
●Amendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current/ - Classification of liabilities as current or non-current/ Non-current
liabilities with covenants;
●Pillar 2 in Brazil (“MP”) n° 1,262/2024: imposes a corporate tax surcharge (Additional CSLL) intended to function as Brazil’s QDMTT (Qualified

Working Capital
In April 2025, the Company entered into a new loan agreement with Banco Santander in the amount of R$8,642, structured as five monthly
installments of R$500 each and a final installment of R$6,142, maturing in October 2025. On the same date, the remaining balance of a previous loan
agreement, originally contracted at R$25,000, with an outstanding balance of approximately R$6,000 as of April 2025, was fully settled.
Also in April 2025, the Company entered into a new loan agreement with Banco ABC in the amount of R$ 14,002, structured as four monthly
installments of R$ 600, three monthly installments of R$1,500 each, and a final installment of R$ 7,100, maturing in December 2025. On the same
date, the remaining balance of a previous loan agreement, originally contracted at R$ 18,000, with an outstanding balance of approximately R$ 14,000
as of April 2025, was fully settled.
Covenants
The Company has certain covenants related to its loans and financing, which are customary for agreements of this nature. The most restrictive financial
covenant is related to leverage and is measured as follows:
● A net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. For the relevant agreements, net debt is defined as gross debt (as set forth in the contracts) minus cash and cash
equivalents, financial investments, and short- and long-term financial assets (such as derivatives). EBITDA is defined as earnings for the last
twelve months before income tax and social contribution, depreciation and amortization, financial results, non-operational income and
expenses, equity income from unconsolidated entities, and non-controlling interests, excluding the effects of IFRS 16 – Leases.
As of June 30, 2025, the Company obtained a formal waiver from BTG Pactual regarding the Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA covenant, originally set at
2.5x. Pursuant to the terms of the waiver, compliance with this covenant is deemed satisfied. The waiver applies exclusively to the interim financial
statements for the quarters ended June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025, and was formally documented through the appropriate consent.

As of June 30, 2025, the Company did not comply with the financial covenant set forth in the financing agreements with Itau, Riza e Votorantim, which
required maintaining the Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio at no more than 2.0x. Pursuant to the contractual terms, the breach of this covenant would
alternatively require an additional reduction of the Company’s acquisition-related liabilities in the minimum amount of R$50,000 (fifty million reais),
through payment with shares of the Company’s parent or with proceeds from a capital contribution. The Company obtained a formal waiver from the
lending banks with respect to this non-compliance, and therefore no event of default or early termination has been triggered.
In addition, Riza granted the Company a waiver for the covenant requiring the maintenance of an Adjusted Gross Margin above 30% (thirty percent)
for the quarters ended March 31 and June 30, 2025.
Furthermore, the Company’s working capital agreements contain cross-default provisions, which may be triggered by a default under other financing
agreements.
Accordingly, the Company was not in breach of any financial covenants related to the issuance of commercial notes or other financing instruments as of
June 30, 2025, and remains in full compliance with all its contractual obligations. Management does not anticipate any short- or medium-term impacts
on its operations arising from restrictive clauses or future covenant testing.
Contractual clauses
The Company holds financing agreements totaling R$75,830, which are secured by collateral ranging from 20% to 50% of its accounts receivable, and
by financial investments recorded in current assets.
The Company also maintains financing agreements with Bradesco and Santander in the amounts of R$8,217 and R$7,720, respectively. These
agreements are guaranteed by the assignment of receivables from Bradesco and Santander, who are also clients of the Company.
Through its subsidiary, One to One, the Company entered into a financing agreement involving the issuance of debentures secured by:

25.Earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing loss of the period by the weighted average number of common shares existing during the period.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income for the period by weighted average number of common shares existing during the period plus
weighted average number of common shares that would be issued upon conversion of all potentially dilutive common shares into common shares.
For the six months period June 30, 2025 and 2024, the number of shares used to calculate the diluted net loss per share of common stock attributable to common
shareholders is the same as the number of shares used to calculate the basic net loss per share of common stock attributable to common shareholders for the period
presented because potentially dilutive shares would have been antidilutive if included in the calculation. The tables below show data of loss and shares used in
calculating basic and diluted earnings per share.

26.2.Financial risk management
The main financial risks to which the Company and its subsidiaries are exposed when conducting their activities are:
(a)Credit risk
It results from any difficulty in collecting the amounts of services provided to the customers. The Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to credit
risk from their interest earning bank deposits. The credit risk related to the provision of services is minimized by a strict control of the customer base
and active delinquency management by means of clear policies regarding the concession of services. There is no concentration of transactions with
customers and the default level is historically very low. In connection with credit risk relating to financial institutions, the Company and its subsidiaries
seek to diversify such exposure among financial institutions.
Credit risk exposure
The book value of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum credit risk exposure on financial information date was:
June 30, 2025 December 31, 2024
Cash and cash equivalents 32,611 116,884
Restricted cash 3,415 10,891
Trade accounts receivable 203,895 171,190
Total 239,921 298,965
The Company determines its allowance for expected credit losses by applying a loss rate calculated on historical effective losses on sales.
Additionally, the Company considers that accounts receivable had a significant increase in credit risk and provides for:
● All notes receivable past due for more than 90 days;
● Notes subject to additional credit analysis presenting indicators of significant risks of default based on ongoing renegotiations, failure
indicators or judicial recovery ongoing processes and customers with relevant evidence of cash deteriorating situation.

(b)Market Risk
Interest rate and inflation risk: Interest rate risk arises from the portion of debt and interest earning bank deposits remunerated at CDI (Interbank
Deposit Certificate) rate, which may adversely affect the financial income or expenses in the event an unfavorable change in interest and inflation rates
takes place.
(c)Operations with derivatives
The Company recognized a liability for an embedded derivative related to a contractual clause that may become effective upon the occurrence of a
specified triggering event under the Bobsin Corp investment agreement. The instrument is not held for speculative purposes; its economic objective is
to mitigate potential financial exposure associated with such an event.
On September 19, 2024, the Company entered into a non-speculative swap agreement with an accrual clause (“SWAP ACC”) to manage exposure to
changes in interest rates.
The derivative financial instruments designated in hedge operations are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is
executed and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value. Changes in the fair value of any of these derivative instruments are immediately
recognized in the statement of profit or loss under “net financial cost”. As of June 30, 2025, the Company has an obligation of R$17,904 (R$41,814 on
December 31, 2024) registered as derivative financial instruments.
(d)Liquidity risk
The liquidity risk consists of the risk of the Company not having sufficient funds to settle its financial liabilities. The Company’s and its subsidiaries’
cash flow and liquidity control are closely monitored by Company’s Management, so as to ensure that cash operating generation and previous fund
raising, as necessary, are sufficient to maintain the payment schedule, thus not generating liquidity risk for the Company and its subsidiaries.
We are committed to and have been taking all the necessary actions that we consider necessary to enable the Company to obtain the funding to ensure it
will continue its regular operations in the next twelve months, including raising new credit lines and/or issuing new equity, among other alternatives.
