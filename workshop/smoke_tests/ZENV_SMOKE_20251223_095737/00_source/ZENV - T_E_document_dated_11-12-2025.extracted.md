MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
[Abrupt Start]
Shay Chor
00:00:05 ...that we mentioned last quarter...
Unverified Participant
00:00:07 Good morning.
Shay Chor
00:00:06 ...that is still being passed on to clients throughout the year. We expect to see CPaaS margins
normalizing closer to 20% by Q4 of this year. Both performances mainly explain the drop in
consolidated adjusted gross profit and margin that you can see in the third chart.
00:00:22 Moving on, let's now discuss our G&A, which helped offset a bit this increase in gross profit. When
comparing first half of 2025 with the same period in 2024, G&A expenses went down 25%,
reaching BRL 48 million. If we exclude the BRL 8 million severance expense from Q1, this figure will
be closer to BRL 40 million. We have been very diligent and strict with our expenses since the end
of 2022 when we started our streamlining efforts. Our current level is now one third of what it was
in the first half of 2022 and less than half of what we recorded in the nine months of 2022.
00:00:57 Also, as a percentage of revenues, G&A is now at 8.3%, down 6.2 percentage points from the 14.5%
reported in the same period of 2024. Excluding the severance, the ratio would be at 7% of
revenues. At the end of 2022, this ratio was around 18%. This strong performance is mainly related
to workforce reduction of approximately 15% announced in January that is expected to result in
cost savings between BRL 30 million and BRL 35 million in full-year 2024, already factoring in the
severance expenses.

Now, looking into our EBITDA, we recognize this quarter came in below our expectations for the
reasons I just explained. However, when we look at the trailing 12 months in June in this chart, we
can see a more resilient performance, especially considering the very volatile and competitive
environment we have been navigating in the recent quarters. We are consistently delivering
around BRL 100 million in normalized EBITDA in a 12-month period. In this sense, we are confident
to be in the right direction to accelerate profitability from the second half of the year and create
the solid foundation for 2026.
00:02:05 Let me finish with the key takeaways to wrap up our prepared remarks. As we announced in
January, when we disclosed our new strategic cycle, Zenvia Customer Cloud is our new core
business and 2025 is the year that we are ramping up the platform in Brazil and Latin America. We
knew this process would take a toll on our short-term profitability, but we started to see first signs
of performance already in this quarter. At the same time, we are making our operations leaner and
stepping up our efficiency efforts with AI playing a key role. It is shaping both how we deliver for
clients and how we operate day-to-day inside the company.
00:02:38 So, in a nutshell, our focus is clear: grow faster, scale smarter, and keep deleveraging the company.
As for the CPaaS, market dynamics will remain volatile, but we expect profitability levels to
gradually recover and return to more normalized level by the end of the year. Back in January, we
also shared that we are evaluating options to divest non-core assets. We see meaningful value in
these businesses, and selective divestments could be an important lever to optimize our balance
sheet. Our goal with all these action is to build a stronger company with solid metrics that
translate into real value for our shareholders.
00:03:43 With that, I'll wrap my prepared remarks and open the floor for your questions.
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
00:04:00 Answer – Unidentified speaker: We will now begin the question-and-answer session.
00:04:04 Answer – Shay Chor: Here we go. There are some questions in the webcast, so I'll start with them
and we'll keep going. Can you put a bit more color on forward guidance for Zenvia Customer
Cloud? How's Q3 looking and Q4 in terms of bookings? How's the franchise channel doing? And
are you still expecting to hit the BRL 200 million target with 65% to 70% gross margin range for the
full year?
00:04:26 Let me start here with some numbers. And then, Cassio, feel free to add some qualitative points
about Zenvia Customer Cloud and there are a couple of other questions on it. So, in terms of
numbers, as we said earlier in the year, in January when we talked about the new strategic cycle
and our focus on Zenvia Customer Cloud, we disclosed that we were expecting this business to be
around BRL 200 million in revenues with a growth of between 25% – around 25% and gross margin
close to 70%, and we are keeping this. As you saw in our results here in the first half of the year,
Zenvia Customer Cloud is growing close to 25%, we grew 23%.
00:05:18 So, it is as we were expecting and we continue to maintain our expectations of a business around
BRL 200 million in revenues and gross margin around 70%, growing close to 25%. No changes. No
changes to that. Cassio, I think it would be interesting if you can share some thoughts on how is it
going. There's – there are other questions here about if we changed anything since we launched
the business in October. There was an acceleration of the business now in the second quarter. Can
Page 2 of 6

--- Page 3 ---
you share us some qualitative points and your view on how – where we're going with Zenvia
Customer Cloud?
00:05:59 Answer – Cassio Bobsin: Sure. Although we have this seasonality on our side when we look at our
Zenvia Customer Cloud, we're very pretty well. We're very excited with our performance of the
business as we look not only on the revenue growth but also on the usage of the software, which
is very important in the SaaS model that is based on how much companies use our software. We
are seeing a very strong adoption on this side. For instance, Q2, we had around 80% increase in
total usage, comparing to Q1, of Zenvia Customer Cloud, which means this block of (00:18:47) the
stream of adoption of the software is going to bring results on the mid – short to midterm for our
company, so it's doing pretty well on that side.
00:06:46 And about the franchising model, we launched that Q1. So, we're still in the early days of this
project (00:19:07) but it's already representing around 15% of our new MRR (00:19:12) in Brazil,
where it is the country that we launched the first of this model? So, it's – even though it's in the
early days, it's already making a difference in new MRR. We have around 30 so franchises that
made sales. We had zero in January. So, we now have 30 – around 34. And we're starting to test
this model outside Brazil as well. We already have some partners operating in different countries
and we're going to evolve them into franchisees in the midterm. So expect this strategy to be, in
the next couple of quarters, the main generator of new MRR for the business, which means we're
building scale around Zenvia Customer Cloud. And this is doing pretty well business wise, that's
why we – when we see the targets that we're having for mid to long term on Zenvia Customer
Cloud, it's being proved on the combination of new customers and software adoption, which of
course, translates into revenue. So, we are excited about these results.
00:08:24 Answer – Shay Chor: Thank – thanks, Cassio. Another question here. On the CPaaS side, are these
type margins the new level or should we expect some recovery?
00:08:35 So, as I mentioned, and Cassio also just mentioned, the CPaaS has been very competitive. We saw
– I would – and Cassio, correct me if I'm wrong here, but the last time we saw business being that
competitive was in the second half of 2022 when we saw a lot of pricing pressure. And – but we are
navigating this and we understand that our strategy is the right one in terms of – and we've been
accelerating revenues, which means we are competitive in pricing. That will – obviously, that puts
some pressuring on margins in the short term, but that's important from a relationship
perspective. And that business helps generating EBITDA after all. So, it's important to keep that in
mind.
00:09:23 And also, first half of the year is usually when we have cost increases from the carriers and we
pass that through prices throughout the year. So, we expect later on the year, closer to year end
and Q4, to have passed through most of the cost increase that we suffered from the carriers. And
therefore, margins will stabilize at the higher level than it is right now. But it's a commoditized
business. It gets volatile. It gets pricing pressure from time to time.
00:09:55 That was the logic behind – one of the logics behind our decision to move – in the last strategic
cycle, to move and to diversify revenues into a different type of business and adding value to the
pure channel, which was the business back in late 2018 to 2019. So – but it's still a good chunk of
our revenues. And it's important – although margins are under pressure, it's important because
that business generates EBITDA. I don't know, Cassio, if you want to add anything on the CPaaS
side in the market dynamics?

--- Page 4 ---
00:10:37 Answer – Cassio Bobsin: Yeah, sure. We have been executing a long-term strategy and we're
sticking to the plan. There's, of course, the maturity of the CPaaS business model, which brings
more pressure on the margins. It's highly competitive. And of course, there is the volatility that
affects results. That's why we understand that when we compare that with the SaaS business,
which is also, of course, every business is competitive in software, but it's more stable and we can
grow our customer base and have a more – a recurrent revenue that's much more reliable in terms
of forecasting. So, understand that this strategy is why we IPO-ed is the one that we've been
executing and is doing pretty well. The acquisitions, they're doing integrations. We launched the
new product that consolidates (00:23:42) all of that and it's performing pretty well. So, I would say
that, although we have this volatility, we're sticking to the plan and it's working.
00:11:42 Answer – Shay Chor: Another here for you, Cassio. On the enterprise side, how are you seeing the
businesses on both Zenvia Customer Cloud and the rest of SaaS, how the dynamics have been?
00:11:52 Answer – Cassio Bobsin: Sure. On the CPaaS, business is pretty mature. It's low margin, high
volume, and we've been able to keep enterprise customers. So, where – as we are the main player,
the more robust and reliable in Brazil, so we are able to keep the best customers on board. That's
why we have all these big revenue on the CPaaS side.
00:12:20 And then, look at SaaS, especially Zenvia Customer Cloud, we aimed initially into SMBs. That was
the beginning of the launch of the product. But as we brought this product and our whole
experience with enterprise customers to some of our customers, they started to adopt as well.
That's why we are seeing the adoption of Zenvia Customer Cloud by enterprise customers. That
wasn't the initial focus, but it's doing well.
00:12:53 Of course, sales cycles are longer, adoption takes some more time, but we're seeing that the
combination of SMBs and enterprise customers for Zenvia Customer is also operating. So, it's a
good – it's an upside on the initial strategy. And we're being able, with the whole experience that
the team has on serving these customers, being able to bring that into this new product.
00:13:19 Answer – Shay Chor: Okay. So, there's another one here. Could you – this is for me. Could you
please provide some color on cash flow and divestitures?
00:13:27 Sure. So, on cash flow, and we put on the presentation chart with it, if we look into our trailing last
12 months EBITDA, it's close to – on a normalized basis, it's close to BRL 100 million, which is pretty
much the same level that we saw in the last couple of quarters, which means, thinking about pure
cash flow, so EBITDA is about BRL 100 million in 12 months. There is about BRL 35 million, BRL 40
million in CapEx that you have to exclude from that EBITDA. So, that leaves us with approximately
BRL 60 million to BRL 65 million in cash flow to serve the debt, which is pretty much puts us close
to breakeven by year end.
00:14:21 And that's why we've been analyzing alternatives to divest. There is no – not much we can add on
selling assets on top of what we are already mentioned in our prepared remarks. We've been
analyzing opportunities and looking into alternatives. And if and when there is anything new to
talk about it, we will let all the market and investors know about it. As of now, there's nothing we
can add on this.

--- Page 5 ---
00:15:03 How should we think about the potential divestment of CPaaS? In an interview, the CFO had
mentioned that they tend to sell for one-time revenue, which will be more than $100 million. Is
that achievable? That would put the company in a net cash position if you manage to sell it.
00:15:19 So, again, we can't discuss specifically any of the divestments that we have possibilities. I did
mention historical – it is correct, I did mention historical transactions in CPaaS close to one-time
revenue, but that's on a global basis and it's very – again, it depends on market conditions, it
depends on macroenvironment, such as interest rates, such as the volatility in the local market. So,
it's – again, it could range and we are looking more into divestment. It doesn't matter if it's CPaaS,
if it's all other SaaS that we don't see in the long term as relevant to the business. The reality is that
the asset divestment has to do with deleveraging balance sheet. It should be opportunistic to
deleverage balance sheet, as simple as that.
00:16:28 We understand that all our assets are important. They add value to our clients. So, it's a matter of
using this as a financial strategy to accelerate balance sheet deleveraging and being able actually
to have a better capital structure to accelerate Zenvia Customer Cloud. So, it's as simple as that.
We are not sharing any numbers and evaluation now. What we can say is we are looking in an
opportunistic way to deleverage the balance sheet.
00:17:35 Hugo (00:29:18), can you re-poll to see if there is any questions live to be made?
00:17:42 Answer – Unidentified speaker: Sure, Shay.
00:17:42 Answer – Shay Chor: We would like – this is it, Hugo (00:29:57).
00:17:47 Answer – Unidentified speaker: So, this concludes our Q&A session. I would like to turn the
conference back over to Mr. Cassio Bobsin for his closing remarks.
00:18:00 Answer – Shay Chor: There's more further question. So, we have a question there. (00:30:15)
answer this last one.
Answer – Unidentified speaker: Sorry.
00:18:05 Answer – Shay Chor: Yeah. Yeah, it just came in. Cassio, what do you think the business will look
like in two to three years?
00:18:12 Answer – Cassio Bobsin: Wow, what a smart (00:30:25) last question. Well, what we've been
working on is to have the core of Zenvia being built around Zenvia Customer Cloud. And that
means that we're working in to provide companies a centralized way to manage all customer
relationships, especially for B2C or massive B2B companies. And this means providing a software
for marketing sales, customer support, customer service, and customer engagement. And this is,
over time, gets – it's a kind of technology that will be, although it's – nowadays, it's different
providers, it's very specialized providers. This is getting more unified.
00:19:07 So, we are seeing this adoption of companies using just one provider to manage all of these
relationships. And as we're building these software, we see that create – creates lots of benefits.
When we put that in context of AI new automation, the way we provide that for our customers is a
way that helps them to automate and reduce costs, become more efficient, and provide more
Page 5 of 6

--- Page 6 ---
value to their customers. So, when we look from a business perspective, we're in the right track to
be the AI CX SaaS provider for these companies. And this means getting very sticky, getting
recurrent revenues, which builds, of course, a strong business over time.
00:19:55 We're not, of course, disclosing that in terms of finance (00:32:10), but we tend to move from these
volatile revenues, low margins, to a recurrent, stable, high-margin business. As we've been able to
optimize the whole company, we're seeing that we're able to increase recurrent revenues and
reduce G&A, which brings, of course, a combination of not only a very strong growth but a – with a
high profitability on the whole business. That's what we're building. As a founder and CEO, now
we're building the foundations and we're seeing the results of this strategy. That's why I see that,
on the next two to three years, it's going to be a very different company financial wise, and we're
seeing that operating (00:33:00) and the early days of Zenvia Customer Cloud, and we expect to
have all this benefit in the next two to three years.
00:20:57 So, for that, I also close here the webcast. I thank you very much for all your attention and to
seeing the evolution of Zenvia. We're building the strategy from a long term. We just are starting a
new strategic cycle with Zenvia Customer Cloud at its core, and we expect that, next couple of
quarters, we are going to understand how this is all playing out to be a very strong AI SaaS
provider for Latin America and the whole world. Thank you very much.
00:21:38 So, this concludes our Q&A session, and I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Cassio
Bobsin for his closing remarks.
00:21:46 Well, already closed my remarks. So, that's it, guys. Thank you very much. See you next time.
00:21:53 The conference has now concluded. Zenvia's IR team is at your disposal to answer any additional
questions. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a nice
day.
