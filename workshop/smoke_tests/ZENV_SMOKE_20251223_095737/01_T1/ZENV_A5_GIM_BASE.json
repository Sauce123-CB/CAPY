The investment case hinges on two binary outcomes: (1) successful CPaaS divestiture at reasonable valuation to repair the balance sheet, and (2) Zenvia Customer Cloud achieving scale and profitability to justify a SaaS-like valuation multiple. Current financials reflect a company trapped between two business models—CPaaS margin erosion drags down consolidated profitability despite SaaS progress. The GIM models a successful pivot: revenue declines from BRL 1,040MM (2025) to BRL 350MM (2029) as low-margin CPaaS exits, but margins expand dramatically (22% → 68% gross, 9% → 28% EBITDA) as the SaaS mix reaches 100%. The BRL 435MM net proceeds from CPaaS sale (2027) are the critical inflection point, eliminating liquidity stress and funding SaaS growth. Failure to execute this pivot results in a bear case of continued margin compression, cash burn, and eventual distressed restructuring.",
