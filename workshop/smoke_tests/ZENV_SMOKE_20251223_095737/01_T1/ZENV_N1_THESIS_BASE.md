## Executive Summary

Zenvia is a Brazilian customer experience (CX) platform company attempting a high-risk, high-reward strategic pivot from a commoditized Communications-Platform-as-a-Service (CPaaS) business to a pure-play SaaS model centered on its Zenvia Customer Cloud product. The investment case is binary: **success requires both (1) divesting the CPaaS business at reasonable valuation (~BRL 450MM) to repair a severely stressed balance sheet, and (2) scaling the SaaS platform to BRL 350-400MM revenue by 2029 at 65-70% gross margins.**

The market is pricing Zenvia for failure—the current ~BRL 326MM market cap implies deep skepticism that management can execute this transition. If the pivot succeeds, the company transforms from a low-margin, capital-constrained also-ran into a high-margin, capital-light SaaS platform with a credible competitive moat in the Latin American CX market. If it fails, negative working capital (BRL -444MM), covenant breaches, and cash burn lead to distressed restructuring or dilutive refinancing.

This is a **special situation / turnaround investment** with asymmetric payoff: 3-5x upside if the strategic pivot executes cleanly, versus 40-60% downside if it stumbles. The base case probability of success is ~50%, with material execution risk across all dimensions.

## The Strategic Pivot: From Commodity to Platform

### What Zenvia Is Today (The Problem)

Zenvia operates two businesses with radically different economics:

1. **CPaaS (72% of Q2 2025 revenue, BRL 205MM quarterly):**
   - Commoditized WhatsApp/SMS messaging infrastructure
   - Gross margin collapsed from 24% (Q2 2024) to 12% (Q2 2025)
   - Facing severe pricing pressure from carriers and competitors
   - High volume, low margin, minimal differentiation
   - Industry-wide race to the bottom on pricing

2. **SaaS (28% of Q2 2025 revenue, BRL 81MM quarterly):**
   - Zenvia Customer Cloud: unified platform for marketing, sales, service, and engagement
   - Gross margin 55% and expanding toward 70% target
   - Growing 23% YoY with early traction (80% usage increase Q2 vs Q1 2025)
   - Franchisee channel launched Q1 2025: 34 franchisees, 15% of new Brazil MRR
   - AI-driven automation positioning for Latin American mid-market

**The blended result is a death spiral:** Consolidated gross margin compressed from 38% (H1 2024) to 20% (H1 2025). Operating cash flow declining. Negative working capital of BRL -444MM. Covenant breaches requiring waivers. The company is trapped between two business models—CPaaS pulls down profitability despite SaaS progress.

### What Zenvia Wants to Become (The Vision)

Management announced in January 2025 a new strategic cycle focused exclusively on Zenvia Customer Cloud. The plan:

- **Phase 1 (2025-2026):** Separate CPaaS as independent business unit, stabilize operations
- **Phase 2 (2027):** Divest CPaaS at ~1.0x revenue (~BRL 450MM proceeds based on BRL 420MM annualized CPaaS revenue)
- **Phase 3 (2027-2029):** Use proceeds to deleverage balance sheet (clear BRL 271MM acquisition liabilities, repay BRL 60MM net debt) and fund SaaS scaling
- **End State (2029):** Pure-play SaaS business with BRL 350-400MM revenue, 68% gross margin, 28% EBITDA margin

This is a **portfolio carve-out strategy**: Exit the low-margin commodity business, double down on the high-margin platform business. Conceptually sound. Execution is everything.

## Investment Thesis Components

### Thesis Pillar 1: CPaaS Divestiture Unlocks Balance Sheet

**The Setup:** Zenvia's balance sheet is a mess. Negative working capital, declining cash (BRL 117MM Dec 2024 → BRL 33MM June 2025), net debt BRL 60MM, acquisition liabilities BRL 271MM, covenant breaches. The company is burning cash and approaching a liquidity crisis absent asset sales or dilutive equity raises.

**The Catalyst:** CPaaS divestiture at ~BRL 450MM (1.0x revenue multiple, in line with historical global CPaaS transactions cited by CFO). Proceeds structure:
- Clear BRL 271MM acquisition liabilities → eliminates overhang from Movidesk/SenseData/D1 deals
- Repay BRL 60MM net debt → delevered balance sheet
- Fund BRL 50-80MM SaaS growth investments → platform development, sales expansion
- Retain BRL 40-70MM cash buffer → working capital normalization

**The Payoff:** Post-divestiture, Zenvia emerges with a clean balance sheet, normalized working capital, and capital to fund SaaS scaling. Financial distress risk evaporates. Cost of capital declines. Strategic optionality increases.

**Key Risks:**
- **Execution risk (HIGH):** CPaaS M&A market deteriorating. Buyer appetite uncertain. 18-24 month process from announcement (Dec 2025) to close (mid-2027 target).
- **Valuation risk (MEDIUM):** Market conditions could force sub-1.0x multiple (0.7-0.8x = BRL 280-320MM), insufficient to clear all liabilities.
- **Timing risk (HIGH):** If divestiture fails or delays beyond 2027, liquidity crisis forces distressed alternative (equity raise at depressed valuation, asset fire sale).

**Probability Assessment:** 50% base case (executes at 0.9-1.1x revenue), 20% bull (executes at 1.2x), 30% bear (fails or <0.7x).

### Thesis Pillar 2: SaaS Platform Scales to Critical Mass

**The Product:** Zenvia Customer Cloud is a unified CX platform integrating:
- **Zenvia Attraction:** Multi-channel customer acquisition campaigns
- **Zenvia Conversion:** Lead-to-sale conversion across channels
- **Zenvia Service:** Omnichannel customer support
- **Zenvia Success:** Cross-sell/upsell and retention

Positioning: "AI CX SaaS provider for Latin America." Target: Mid-market B2C and B2B companies (thousands of employees, high customer interaction volumes). Key differentiator: Purpose-built for LatAm market (WhatsApp-first, Portuguese/Spanish, local integrations).

**The Traction:** Early signs of product-market fit:
- 23% YoY revenue growth (on track for BRL 200MM FY 2025 target)
- 80% usage increase Q2 vs Q1 2025 (engagement deepening)
- 55% gross margin expanding toward 70% (scaling economics)
- Franchisee channel: 34 franchisees, 15% of new MRR in Brazil (go-to-market innovation)
- Enterprise customers adopting despite SMB initial focus (upmarket traction)

**The Path:** Management targets 25-30% CAGR through 2029:
- 2025: BRL 200MM (baseline)
- 2027: BRL 255MM (post-CPaaS exit, accelerated focus)
- 2029: BRL 350MM (mature SaaS platform)

Gross margin expansion: 55% (2025) → 68% (2029) via operational leverage and platform economies of scale. EBITDA margin: 9% (2025 blended) → 28% (2029 SaaS-only) as G&A scales efficiently.

**Key Risks:**
- **Competitive risk (HIGH):** Facing global incumbents (Salesforce, HubSpot, Zendesk) and regional players (VTEX, etc.). Differentiation unclear beyond "LatAm-native."
- **Scaling risk (MEDIUM):** 25-30% CAGR requires efficient customer acquisition. Franchisee model unproven at scale. Churn could accelerate if product gaps emerge.
- **Margin risk (MEDIUM):** 68-70% gross margin assumes operational leverage. Could be pressured by pricing competition or elevated customer success costs.

**Probability Assessment:** 50% base case (25% CAGR, 68% margin), 20% bull (35% CAGR, 70% margin), 30% bear (15% CAGR, 60% margin).

---

### Thesis Pillar 3: Management Executing Efficiently Amid Churn

**The Track Record:**
- **Cost discipline:** G&A reduced 25% YoY (BRL 65MM → BRL 48MM H1 2024 vs H1 2025). G&A as % revenue improved from 14.5% to 8.3%. Workforce cut 15% (Jan 2025) with BRL 30-35MM annual savings.
- **M&A integration:** Successfully integrated Movidesk, SenseData, D1 into platform. Zenvia Customer Cloud built on these assets.
- **Financial engineering:** Renegotiated debt (18→36 month terms), obtained covenant waivers, structured option to convert BRL 100MM M&A liabilities to equity.

**The Concerns:**
- **Leadership churn:** CFO change (Sept 2025: Shay Chor → Piero Rosatelli, former Oria investor). CHRO and CTO departed (Dec 2025), roles absorbed by CFO and CRO. Streamlining or instability?
- **Execution complexity:** Managing CPaaS separation, SaaS scaling, balance sheet repair, and organizational transition simultaneously.
- **Founder-investor dynamics:** CEO Cassio Bobsin (founder) + Piero Rosatelli (former Oria partner, now CFO). Alignment strong but potential for conflicts.

**Probability Assessment:** Management has demonstrated cost discipline and financial navigation capability. New CFO brings investor mindset (potentially shareholder-friendly). Execution risk elevated but not disqualifying.

## Valuation Framework

### Current Market Pricing

- **Market Cap:** BRL 326MM
- **Enterprise Value:** BRL 326MM + BRL 60MM net debt + BRL 271MM acquisition liabilities - BRL 33MM cash = **BRL 624MM**
- **EV/Revenue (2025E):** 624 / 1,040 = **0.6x**
- **EV/EBITDA (2025E):** 624 / 95 = **6.6x**

Market is pricing Zenvia as a distressed, declining business. 0.6x revenue multiple is appropriate for a commoditized, margin-compressed, capital-constrained company with going concern risk.

### Intrinsic Value Scenarios

**Bull Case (20% probability): SaaS Breakout**
- CPaaS divests early 2027 at BRL 540MM (1.2x revenue)
- SaaS accelerates to 35% CAGR, BRL 450MM by 2029
- Gross margin 70%, EBITDA margin 32%
- Terminal value: BRL 450MM × 32% = BRL 144MM EBITDA at 18x = BRL 2,592MM
- PV at 22% DR ≈ BRL 1,200MM → **~BRL 23/share** (~3.7x upside)

**Base Case (50% probability): Successful Pivot**
- CPaaS divests mid-2027 at BRL 450MM (1.0x revenue)
- SaaS grows 25% CAGR, BRL 350MM by 2029
- Gross margin 68%, EBITDA margin 28%
- Terminal value: BRL 350MM × 28% = BRL 98MM EBITDA at 15x = BRL 1,470MM
- PV at 22% DR ≈ BRL 750MM → **~BRL 14/share** (~2.3x upside)

**Bear Case (30% probability): Stranded Asset**
- CPaaS divestiture fails or BRL 280MM (0.7x revenue)
- SaaS grows 15% CAGR, BRL 250MM by 2029
- Gross margin 60%, EBITDA margin 18%
- Liquidity crisis forces dilutive equity raise (30% dilution)
- Terminal value: BRL 250MM × 18% = BRL 45MM EBITDA at 10x = BRL 450MM
- PV at 22% DR ≈ BRL 250MM post-dilution → **~BRL 4/share** (~35% downside)

**Probability-Weighted Fair Value:** (0.20 × 23) + (0.50 × 14) + (0.30 × 4) = **BRL ~12.80/share**

**Current Price:** BRL 6.20/share
**Implied Upside:** ~106%
**Risk/Reward:** 2.7x upside (base+bull) vs 0.35x downside (bear)

## Investment Recommendation: SPECULATIVE BUY

### Why Buy?

1. **Asymmetric payoff:** 2-3x upside in base case, 3-4x in bull case, versus 35-50% downside in bear case.
2. **Catalyst-rich:** CPaaS divestiture announcement (done), separation execution (2025-2026), transaction close (2027 target), SaaS scaling milestones (quarterly).
3. **Market mispricing:** 0.6x revenue multiple assumes failure. Even partial success (CPaaS exits at 0.8x, SaaS grows 20%) yields >50% upside.
4. **Hidden asset value:** CPaaS alone worth BRL 350-450MM (0.8-1.0x revenue). SaaS growing at 23% with 55% margins. Market cap BRL 326MM = free option on SaaS.

### Key Risks to Monitor

1. **Liquidity crisis (Q1-Q2 2026):** Cash burn trajectory. Covenant compliance. Need for bridge financing.
2. **CPaaS divestiture progress (2025-2027):** Buyer engagement, valuation range, transaction milestones.
3. **SaaS scaling velocity (quarterly):** Revenue growth, gross margin, franchisee productivity, enterprise traction.
4. **Competitive dynamics:** Pricing pressure in SaaS, market share losses, churn trends.

### Position Sizing Guidance

This is a **high-risk, high-reward special situation.** Appropriate for risk-tolerant investors with:
- **Small position size:** 1-3% of portfolio given binary outcome and execution uncertainty
- **Long time horizon:** 18-36 months to CPaaS exit + 12-24 months post-divestiture SaaS scaling
- **Catalyst monitoring:** Quarterly earnings, divestiture updates, balance sheet metrics

### What Would Change the Thesis?

**Positive:**
- CPaaS divestiture announced at >1.0x revenue with credible buyer
- SaaS growth accelerates to >30% with expanding margins
- Working capital normalizes, cash balance stabilizes >BRL 80MM

**Negative:**
- CPaaS divestiture abandoned or <0.7x revenue valuation
- SaaS growth decelerates to <20% or margins compress
- Covenant breach triggers acceleration, forced equity raise at material discount

## Conclusion

Zenvia is a binary bet on strategic pivot execution. The company has the right strategy (exit commodity CPaaS, scale high-margin SaaS), early product traction (23% growth, 80% usage increase), and capable management (demonstrated cost discipline). But it's executing from a position of severe financial weakness (negative working capital, covenant breaches, liquidity stress) with multiple execution risks (CPaaS sale timing/valuation, SaaS scaling, competitive pressure).

The market is pricing Zenvia for failure at 0.6x revenue. The risk/reward is compelling: ~100% probability-weighted upside to BRL 12.80/share from BRL 6.20/share today, with 2-3x base case upside and limited downside if you believe management can execute even a mediocre pivot.

**For risk-tolerant, catalyst-focused investors with 2-3 year horizons: Speculative Buy, 1-3% position size.**
